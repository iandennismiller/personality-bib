# Selection Criteria

This is our algorithm for selecting journals.

## stage 1

- rank all journals in psych in terms of papers they produce with keyword "personality" in title, abstract, or keywords
- take top 10 journal; consider these personality journals
- include all papers from top journals

## stage 2

- gather important personality papers in journals not technically personality (e.g. American Psychologist)
- rank-order by number uses of "personality" and h-index to ascertain prominence
- e.g. Costa McCrea; in general psych journals, should be included
