We used a subsample (N = 2,518) of participants across two cohorts from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). All participants were working at Time 1 and a subsample retired between Time 1 and Time 2. A multi-group structural equation model compared the relationships among personality, health, wealth, and well-being between those who continued working and those who retired. Results suggest that wealth and health are related to personality traits (i.e., conscientiousness, neuroticism, and agreeableness), but provide no evidence that the relationships are different for retired and working adults.},

Affective polarization (i.e., differences in evaluations of the in-party and out-party) has important implications for political outcomes including civic engagement and partisan-motivated attitudes and behaviours. In this study, we add to the burgeoning literature on affective polarization by examining moderators of the effect of in-party support on out-party opposition across the three main political parties in New Zealand. Using a large national probability sample of adults (N = 19,078), we assessed the effects of social demographics, Big-Five personality traits, liberal-conservative ideology, political identity centrality, and weekly news exposure on the relationship between in-party and out-party support. Results show political identity centrality is the strongest and most consistent moderator. The effects of some other moderators (e.g., personality, news exposure) are party-specific.},

Method: In open-ended interviews, 122 late-midlife participants described their single greatest life challenge. Participants’ responses were content coded for various coping strategies. We examined correlations between narrated coping strategies and self-reported personality traits assessed by the NEO-Five Factor Inventory. Results: Extraversion was associated with narrated engagement coping. Neuroticism was associated with narrated disengagement coping. A trend suggested that conscientiousness was negatively associated with narrated disengagement coping. Surprisingly, openness was negatively associated with narrated problem-solving. Conclusions: The current study replicates and extends the personality and coping literature into the domain of life narrative. Associations between extraversion, neuroticism, and coping styles appear to be robust outside the context of self-report coping questionnaires.},

Nonclinical participants (N = 196) completed baseline measures, followed by daily questionnaires for 28 days. Multilevel models indicated that trait and daily vulnerable narcissism, as well as trait neuroticism, were positively associated with daily shame. When controlling for vulnerable narcissism, trait grandiose narcissism was unrelated to shame, and daily grandiose narcissism was mostly negatively related to it. As for situations, social stress and workload were related to increased shame, especially in those high in trait neuroticism, or narcissism scales with neurotic content. Results highlight the key role of shame in pathological narcissistic functioning.},

Participants were 173 sophomore students (60% females) who completed two diaries per day (every morning and evening) for 18 days. In line with our predictions, the results suggest that ego-resiliency is a key personal resource that might be able to buffer the detrimental effects of daily stressors on individuals’ negative emotional inertia.

  abstract = {© 2019 Elsevier Inc. Background: There is strong evidence that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) negatively impact mental health. However, the association between ACEs and personality, emotions and affect are poorly understood. Therefore, we examined the association between composite ACE score and ACE type and personality, emotions and positive and negative affect. Methods: Three waves of data from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study were used. ACE was the primary independent correlate. Covariates included demographic variables and survey wave. Outcome variables included generativity, personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, openness, agency), and affect (positive, negative). Statistical analyses included 3 approaches: (1) treatment of ACE as dichotomous, (2) ordinal composite of ACE score, and (3) three individual ACE type components to assess the association between ACE and psychological constructs. Results: Of 6323 adults in the sample, 53% were female, and 56% had a past ACE. In the adjusted analyses, dichotomized ACE was significantly associated with neuroticism (β = 0.10; 95% CI 0.07, 0.13) and conscientiousness (β = −0.03; 95% CI −0.05, −0.01). All ACE scores were significantly and positively associated with neuroticism and negatively associated with conscientiousness. Abuse was significantly associated with neuroticism (β = 0.20; 95% CI 0.16, 0.24), openness (β = 0.08; 95% CI 0.05, 0.11), conscientiousness (β = −0.05; 95% CI −0.08, −0.02), and agency (β = 0.06; 95% CI 0.02, 0.10). All ACE categories, except financial strain, were significantly associated with affect. Conclusion: ACEs are significantly associated with personality, emotions, and affect, with greater effect seen at higher ACE scores and with ACE abuse type, which helps support the cumulative risk hypothesis and our study hypothesis. There is a need for continued research to understand the mechanistic processes and the directionality of the association between ACEs, emotions, and behaviors to help continue to drive biopsychosocial interventions.},

Using latent profile analysis, we identified five profiles (non-actors, deep-actors, moderates, actors, and extreme regulators), and evaluated how profile membership corresponded to relationship quality, self-esteem, and general emotional regulation tendencies. Relationship quality was higher among deep actors and non-actors compared with actors and extreme regulators.

Girls showed substantially higher levels of self-control in kindergarten (β = 0.47) and outperformed boys on standardized tests of reading achievement in third/fourth grade (β = 0.20). Further, kindergarten self-control prospectively predicted reading achievement throughout elementary school (β = 0.37). Connecting these findings, our mediation analyses revealed that the female self-control advantage in kindergarten could account for subsequent gender differences in reading achievement.

Despite conceptual overlap (broadly reflecting self-regulatory functions), executive functions (EF) and effortful control (EC) are rarely jointly studied in relation to broadband psychopathology. The present study investigated associations of correlated factors (internalizing-externalizing) and bifactor psychopathology models with EF and EC in a large (N = 895) childhood community sample (Mage = 11.54, SDage = 2.25). Associations between both self-regulation constructs (EF and EC) with psychopathology were largely accounted for via a general psychopathology factor. However, EC evidenced stronger associations, questioning the utility of task-based EF measures to inform self-regulatory psychopathology.},

We developed the power-exploitation affordances hypothesis that predicts that allocators with lower Honesty-Humility act more exploitative when they have absolute power than when their power is intermediate or shared. Additionally, we also tested these predictions for the actual earnings in these games. The results were generally supportive of our main hypotheses.

Supporting motivational intensity theory's view, PEP response was low in both easy-task conditions but stronger in the high-nAch group than in the low-nAch group in the difficult task.

Objectives: This study investigates the relationship between trait emotional intelligence (trait EI), prosocial behaviour, parental support, and parental psychological control on one hand and PTSD and depression symptoms on the other hand after exposure to war-traumatic events among Palestinian children and adolescents in the Gaza Strip. Methods: The sample consists of 1,029 students aged 11–17 year old. Of them 533 (51.8%) were female and 496 (48.2%) were male. The following measures were used in the study: War-Traumatic Events Checklist (W-TECh), Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire – Adolescent Short Form (TEIQue-ASF), prosocial behaviour (as part of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - SDQ), parental support scale, Parental Psychological Control scale, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders Symptoms Scale (PTSDSS) and the depression scale. Results: 88.4% (N: 909) experienced personal trauma, 83.7% (N: 861) witnessed trauma to others, and 88.3% (N: 908) have seen demolition of property during the war, mostly by boys. The results also demonstrated that the prevalence of PTSD diagnosis according to DSM-V is 53.5% (N: 549). Further, there is a negative correlation between trait EI and prosocial behaviour in one hand and parental psychological control and PTSD and depression symptoms in the other hand. Likewise, a negative correlation was found between parental support and depression symptoms. Low trait EI and parental psychological control significantly mediated the relationship between exposure to war trauma, and PTSD and depression. In addition, negative parenting factors and low prosocial behavior significantly predicted depression. Conclusion: Trait EI and parental support can be utilized in interventions to empower children and adolescents’ emotional abilities, to strengthen their resilience in facing traumatic event exposure, and thus reduce its effect on PTSD and depression symptoms.},

The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) is a recently proposed nosologic framework for psychopathology symptoms and domains that accounts for this tiered organization.

An internal meta-analysis estimated this indirect effect to be of medium size.

The LCM-SR describing anxiety-depression co-occurrence fit well (RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.06). Depression predicted within-person change in social (b = 0.09), physical (b = 0.04), and separation anxiety (b = 0.06) over 13 timepoints. Separation anxiety predicted within-person change in depression (b = 0.08); social and physical anxiety did not. Findings advance knowledge of within-person development of anxiety-depression co-occurrence.},

In two studies (N = 1202), we investigated the relation between this suggested continuum from Inequality Aversion (IA) to Joint Gain Maximization (JGM), the HEXACO personality dimensions, and SVO. To account for differences in fairness perception, we also considered whether inequality favored oneself or the other. As hypothesized, Honesty-Humility was the best basic trait predictor of IA, showing a slightly stronger positive link when inequality was self-advantageous. SVO, in turn, showed a stronger (negative) link when inequality was disadvantageous for the self. Overall, the results show that IA is related to (basic) personality traits in a theoretically meaningful way.},

Meanwhile, official nosologies desginate anhedonia as a more specific characteristic of major depressive disorder. Using a quantitative model of the internalizing domain, we compared the strength of transdiagnostic versus diagnosis-specific pathways from anhedonia to major depression (and other internalizing conditions) during adolescence. We recruited 241 youth ages 14–17 who completed semistructured interviews of anxiety and depressive disorders, as well as several self-report surveys of trait anhedonia and neuroticism. Confirmatory factor analysis of diagnostic correlations revealed good fit for a unidimensional model of the 10 internalizing conditions we assessed. This overarching internalizing dimension was statistically significantly correlated with trait anhedonia (r = 0.17) and neuroticism (r = 0.59). In contrast, anhedonia was virtually unrelated to major depression (r = −0.02), net the internalizing dimension. Thus, in this sample, the connection between anhedonia and major depression was explained by a transdiagnostic dimension presumed to underlie all internalizing problems. Compared to neuroticism, however, anhedonia had a more limited association with internalizing, consistent with established personality models of anxiety and depression. We conclude that these data are consistent with conceptualizing anhedonia predominantly as a transdiagnostic correlate of internalizing conditions, rather than a specific marker of major depression, in developmental psychopathology research and clinical interventions for young people.},

Based on early writings of James (1902) and Starbuck (1911), we tested the hypotheses that adolescents are more likely to experience a religious transformation when they have (a) lower global meaning, (b) lower goal meaning, and (c) higher goal conflict. Participants (N = 137) were adolescents living in Western Europe involved in a service trip with Young Life, an evangelical Christian organization. Participants with lower strivings meaning and higher strivings conflict before the trip were more likely to experience a religious transformation during the trip.},

Research concerning dangerous driving behavior has often favored studying inter-individual differences at the expense of intra-individual ones (especially when verifying its associations with personality factors). Using a 7 weeks diary approach, we aimed at exploring the intra-individual variation of dangerous driving behavior (Errors, Violations and Aggressive driving). Also, we verified if our outcomes could be predicted by both situational variables (weekly km, felt traffic pressure and traffic mood) and dispositional ones (Big-Five personality factors, age and gender). Our findings revealed that Violations, Verbal & Physical aggression and Vehicle aggression had similar intra- to inter-individual variation ratios, with approximately 45% of variance at the intra-individual level. In contrast, Errors had only about 30% of variance at the intra-individual level. Traffic mood was the only significant intra-individual predictor, negatively correlating with all outcomes. Excepting Agreeableness, all personality factors were related to at least one dangerous driving behavior (especially consistent for the association between Extraversion and Aggressive driving). Also, women reported lower levels than men on all outcomes but Errors. Overall, this study raises some questions about the assumed stability of driving behavior, while at the same time confirming several relational patterns between personality factors and dangerous driving.},

Second, using exponential random graph models we demonstrated that shyness across network effects was similar to reversed extraversion (introversion): Both negatively predicted the number of outgoing relations, whereas they did not affect the number of incoming relations. We discuss the issue of locating shyness in the space of personality traits, supporting the relevance of ascribing it to introversion.},

Individual differences in one's propensity to engage the behavioral activation system (BAS) and behavioral inhibition system (BIS) have primarily been studied with Caver and White's (1994) BIS/BAS scale. Whereas, Carver and White identified the BIS as a unidimensional scale, they identified three separable BAS group factors - drive, fun seeking, and reward responsiveness -which Carver urged against combining into a BAS total score. Despite this, a BAS total score has been used extensively although researchers have yet to test whether a BAS general factor exists and, if so, whether a BAS total score can be interpreted as primarily being a measure of the general factor. The current study observed that the best fitting BAS factor model of those we tested was a hierarchical model with three group facets and a general factor. This model was largely invariant across both sex and race/ethnicity. We show, for the first time, that a general factor accounts for the majority of the variance in BAS total scores. Due to the superior fit of the hierarchical model and variance accounted for by the general factor, we conclude that researchers are psychometrically justified in using a BAS total score.},

Judges’ high accuracy did not vary by judges’ attachment orientations. However, greater judge avoidance was associated with lower confidence in ratings. Greater attachment anxiety was linked with weaker associations between accuracy and confidence. We discuss findings in terms of their potential implications for partner selection and future studies that can assess this link.},

  abstract = {© 2019 This manuscript consists of a study and a direct replication of it examining the interactive effect of self-regulatory depletion and impulsivity on points earned in a progressive ratio task. In study 1 (n = 238), participants first completed a measure of delay discounting. Next, they underwent depletion exercises or control exercises. Finally, they completed a progressive ratio task in which they were able to earn points. Non-depleted people performed the same on this task regardless of their level of impulsivity. However, for depleted people, impulsive people earned the most points. This study suggested that when depleted, people prone to instant gratification will work harder than their less impulsive counterparts to earn rewards. To examine the reliability of these findings, we then did a high-powered, direct replication of this study (n = 782). In the replication, we found null results. This pre-registered, well-powered study suggests the findings of study one were a type I error. The findings of study 2 suggest no effect of self-regulatory attention on tasks related to earning points.},

However, little is known about how people may use forms of art and entertainment such as music to enhance their experiences and shape their environments for need satisfaction. In this research, we measured participants’ personality and the linguistic styles of their favorite songs, and observed significant associations between personality traits and linguistic cues in lyrics. These associations were stronger for participants who generally liked a song because of its lyrics rather than melody. Our study is the first to show how one's personality is related to linguistic cues in someone else's writings. It points to the possibility that people may like certain songs because the linguistic cues in the lyrics are congruent with their personality and hence can satisfy personal needs. This expands research on person-situation interaction and literature on personality and language use, and has important practical implications.},

In addition, we show that the changes in materialism cannot be explained by (age-related) differences in socio-demographic variables. Finally, our results indicate that changes in self-uncertainty provide a better account for changes in materialism than age-related changes in self-esteem.},

Quantile regression mixed-effects models allowed predicting zones in which affective states were most likely to occur according to personality. Beyond the well-known effect of personality on affect level, high neuroticism and/or high extraversion were accompanied by heightened affective variability. Results were interpreted as potentially reflecting positive feedback loops oriented toward negative affect for neuroticism, and toward positive affect and activation for extraversion.},

Results: Less interpersonal flexibility was associated with depressive diagnoses. Greater affective instability was associated with bipolar disorder and was negatively associated with psychotic disorders, but showed no association with depressive disorders. Conclusion: Differing degrees of flexibility and instability in emotional and interpersonal domains may be uniquely associated with specific classes of psychological disorders.},

The present study tested an ego-syntonic assumption of personality disorders (PDs) by addressing whether people with higher PD traits ascribe higher functionality to various behavior categories (or “expressions”) of PD traits. Participants (N = 241) completed indices of five PD traits, indicators of PD-trait-expression functionality including perceived frequency of strategic expression and beliefs that expressions are beneficial, are normative, and can be easily executed, and an index of anticipated self-recrimination. Participants with high levels of PD traits reported enhanced functionality to expressions of their PD trait but still indicated that these expressions were dysfunctional and likely to evoke self-recrimination. Findings extend understanding of how people with maladaptive traits perceive these traits and contribute to the issue of ego-syntonicity of PDs.},

We hypothesized that absorbers will demonstrate impaired inhibition and working memory alongside superior imagination abilities. Healthy young Israeli soldiers (N = 160) performed a battery of cognitive tasks. As hypothesized, absorbers were substantially faster in a mental rotation task, and demonstrated impaired accuracy in cognitive tasks demanding high capacity of working memory, inhibition and sustained attention, stemming mostly from commission, rather than omission, errors.

From the perspective of basic personality models, the HEXACO Honesty-Humility factor has yielded most consistent evidence in accounting for inter-individual variation in prosocial behavior in game-theoretic paradigms.

In a large-scale re-analysis across eight studies (N = 1917), we therefore tested whether the relation between Honesty-Humility and Dictator Game giving is affected by the specific (money-related versus money-unrelated) Honesty-Humility indicators. Results revealed strikingly similar effect sizes across scales, suggesting that the link of Honesty-Humility to prosocial behavior can be attributed to the underlying trait itself.},

The current study sought to determine whether the main and interactive effects of the five domains of the Five Factor model (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness) predicted short- and long-term desistance from crime in a sample of seriously delinquent youth. Participants were 1126 males from the Pathways to Desistance study with complete data on at least one of the study variables. The NEO Personality Inventory-Short Form was administered during Wave 4 of the Pathways study and desistance was measured 6–60 months later. Agreeableness was the only scale to consistently and meaningfully predict short- and long-term desistance. These results suggest that Agreeableness may promote desistance in youth with extensive prior involvement in the juvenile justice system.},

Three aspects of heroic self-representations have recently been identified: self-as-savior, self-as-conqueror, and heroic-identification (i.e., linking oneself with heroes). In Israeli-Jewish society, heroism represents a convergence of the cultural myth of the Tzabar (the tough New Jew) with manic-narcissistic defenses that replace helplessness with exhilaration. We expected Heroic identification to epitomize the myth of the Tzabar, and thus to confer the greatest stress-related vulnerability. Israeli adults (N = 812) were assessed pre-and-post a prolonged exposure to missile attacks. Heroic identification prospectively predicted increased anxious mood, both as a main effect and under major stressful life events. Self-as-savior predicted an increased anxious mood under high levels of perceived-stress related to the missile attacks. Possible mechanisms of these effects are discussed.},

Results indicated that both repeated security and anxiety primes were effective in reducing participants’ trait levels of attachment anxiety over time. In contrast, neither prime generally affected participants’ well-being. The fact that both primes had similar results suggests that one “active ingredient” in attachment priming may be reflecting upon close relationships—irrespective of the valence of those relationships.

The authors thank Dean Eckles and André Kretzschmar who independently detected and reported the bug. Due to a misplaced parenthesis, the Fisher's r-to-Z conversion which was described in the text was not applied to the width w of the corridor of stability in the computations. Hence, in the actual computations the width of the corridor was in the r metric, not in the Z metric. For example, for a true value of r =.4 and w =.1, the corridor of stability in the computations actually went from.3 to.5, instead of from.31 to.48, as described in the original paper. From hindsight, the described r-to-Z transformation made Table 1 in the original publication difficult to interpret, as its column headers reported a mix of numbers in different scales: The true correlation in the r metric, and the corridor width in the Z metric. Readers would have had to manually compute a Z-to-r transformation to derive the correct corridor boundaries. For example, a true effect size of ρ =.7 and w =.2 translates to a corridor of stability in the r metric ranging from.65 to.75. Hence, as originally presented, Table 1 is hardly understandable for readers. Incidentally, if the r-to-Z transformation is applied in the computations, the main conclusion still stands: “in typical scenarios the sample size should approach 250 for stable estimates”. In the Z metric, confidence intervals around a correlation are only dependent on sample size and, likewise, the point of stability does not depend on the size of the true correlation. For all δs the point of stability for w =.1 and 80% confidence is around n = 260. To summarize, the coding error means that the computations did not match with the original text description. After some reflection, we think that the relevant textual descriptions in the manuscript should be changed whereas the numerical results as well as the tables in the manuscript should be kept as they are, because what the code did was actually a better approach. Hence, in this correction note we define the width w of the corridor of stability in the r metric, and not, as originally described, in the Z metric. The reported results in Table 1 of the original publication are therefore correct but they should be understood to refer to a corridor width in the r metric. The relevant text in the manuscript describing the procedure also should be understood as referring to a corridor width in the r metric. This correction gives also the opportunity to align the paper with the intuitive understanding of most readers: While the table was difficult to interpret with the original description, it is better interpretable with this corrected description. The authors are sorry for this error, apologise for any inconvenience caused, and highlight the usefulness and necessity of open reproducible code.

(2007) have demonstrated that narcissism is in fact related to higher implicit self-esteem as long as the implicit measure reflects agency. The present study used a large (N = 730) sample, carefully controlled stimuli, improved statistical analyses, and examined narcissism at the facet-level, but results did not replicate those of Campbell et al. In fact, the latent correlation between narcissism and implicit agency was close to zero, whereas the positive correlation between narcissism and explicit agency was replicated. We conclude that narcissists’ implicit self-views may be more neutral than positive or may depend on other contextual factors.},

  abstract = {© 2018 Elsevier Inc. Objectives: Psychopathy is associated with severe forms of antisocial and violent behavior in adults. There is also a rapidly growing body of research focused on extending features of adult psychopathy downward to youth. To date however, the degree to which these features can be consistently and comparatively assessed at these younger ages, remains unclear. This study addresses this issue by investigating measurement invariance of underlying features of psychopathy across childhood and adolescence in a racially diverse sample of youth. Methods: Three cohorts of youth (n = 1517) were assessed annually from childhood to adolescence (ages ∼7–16). Underlying features of psychopathy commonly assessed in youth (e.g. lack of guilt, impulsivity) were examined within a longitudinal bi-factor framework using multi-dimensional item-response theory (IRT) techniques. Differential item functioning was used to assess invariance across development and participant's race (African-American and Caucasian), using two distinct approaches: (1) traditional item-response theory (IRT) methods; and (2) a recently developed Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) approach. Results: Psychopathy features assessed in this study exhibited measurement consistency across development (∼ages 7–16) and were found to tap into the same underlying construct as intended across measurement occasions, and equivalently for African-American and Caucasian youth. Results were similar when assessed using traditional IRT procedures for longitudinal invariance testing and when implementing the more recent BSEM methodology. Conclusions: Findings provide the first evidence that features of psychopathy can be assessed consistently in youth and improve our understanding of important developmental and sociocultural factors associated these features during earlier periods of development.},

  abstract = {© 2017 Since the origins of psychology, curiosity has occupied a pivotal position in the study of motivation, emotion, and cognition; and disciplines as far-ranging as biology, economics, robotics, and leadership. Theorists have disagreed about the basic tenets of curiosity; some researchers contend that the rewards arise when resolving ambiguity and uncertainty whereas others argue that being curious is an intrinsically pleasurable experience. Three studies were conducted to consolidate competing theories and isolated bodies of research. Using data from a community survey of 508 adults (Study 1), 403 adults on MTurk (Study 2), and a nationally representative household survey of 3,000 adults (Study 3), we found evidence for five distinct factors: Joyous Exploration, Deprivation Sensitivity, Stress Tolerance, Social Curiosity, and Thrill Seeking - forming The Five-Dimensional Curiosity Scale (5DC). Each factor had substantive relations with a battery of personality, emotion, and well-being measures. Taking advantage of this multidimensional model, we found evidence for four distinct types of curious people in Study 3 referred to as The Fascinated (28% of sample), Problem Solvers (28%), Empathizers (25%), and Avoiders (19%). Subgroups differed in their passionate interests, areas of expertise, consumer behavior, and social media use; challenging an assumption that there is a homogenous population to be discriminated on a single dimension from incurious to very curious. With greater bandwidth and predictive power, the 5DC offers new opportunities for research on origins, consequences, life outcomes, and intervention strategies to enhance curiosity.},

Same-trait correlations across samples are, on average, positive for all five traits, indicating score agreement.

This finding was replicated across informant types (self, mother, and father), samples (students and a national representative sample, n = 1001), and units of analyses (facets and items). The most frequent approach to preserve the FFM taxonomy of both normal and non-normal personality variants – mapping psychotic-like phenomena onto the Openness domain – found little support in our data. Disintegration was normally distributed in the general population.},

And (2) do scores on standard personality tests correspond to these parameters?

Results showed that, (a) individual differences in density distribution parameters are moderately stable and (b) at the bivariate level, personality was associated with numerous distribution parameters for a number of behaviors/emotions, and situations. However, when the appropriate statistical controls were taken into account, these associations diminished. While individual differences in density distribution parameters we moderately stable, standard personality measures rarely correspond to any other parameters of density distributions once the mean of the density distribution is known. Emotionality and eXtraversion appear as exceptions to this general pattern.

To illustrate the utility of this framework, we investigated effects of Big Five personality traits on the level and the within- and cross-context variability of experience-sampled states (affect, self-esteem, behavior) of psychology freshmen (N = 118).

How can the same underlying psychological/neurobiological system result in both stable between-individual differences and high levels of within-individual variability in personality states over time and situations? We argue that both types of variability result from a psychological system based on structured, chronic motivations, where behavior at a specific point in time is a joint function of the current availability of motive affordances in the situation, current motivationally relevant bodily or interoceptive states, and the result of the competition among alternative active motives. Here we present a biologically-based theoretical framework, embodied in two different computational models, that shows how individuals with stable personality characteristics, can nevertheless exhibit considerable within-person variability in personality states across time and situations.},

More physical activity was associated with people reporting higher levels of Extraversion and Conscientiousness than they usually did, with the associations clearly replicating across samples and generalizing to all items of these domains. This pattern tended to reflect associations at the level of between-individual differences. When the three domains simultaneously predicted activity, within-individual variance in Neuroticism also emerged as a positive predictor, whereas between-individual level associations waned.

At the level of the Big Five domains, we find that the BFI-2-S and BFI-2-XS retain much of the full measure's reliability and validity. At the facet level, we find that the BFI-2-S may be useful for examining facet traits in reasonably large samples, whereas the BFI-2-XS should not be used to assess facets. Finally, we discuss some key tradeoffs to consider when deciding whether to administer an abbreviated form instead of the full BFI-2.},

The goal of the current study was to examine relations from temperamental approach reactivity (i.e., impulsivity, frustration, and positive affect) and effortful control (EC; 42 and 54 months) to teachers’ reports of academic achievement and popularity (72 and 84 months). Frustration was positively related to achievement and negatively related to popularity for girls, but unrelated to boys’ outcomes. Interactions suggested that, among children with high EC or emotional approach (frustration or positive emotion), impulsivity positively predicted achievement. Few gender differences in interactions were noted. These results provide insight into the dynamics relations from temperament/personality to children's academic and social adjustment.},

Further, the potential moderating role of EC on these important school outcomes was assessed. Emotion and engagement were observed at school. EC was assessed by multiple methods. Teachers reported on their student–teacher relationships and students’ externalizing behaviors. Children's emotion expressivity and EC were related to engagement and relationships with teachers as well as behavioral problems at school. Children low in EC may be particularly vulnerable to the poor outcomes associated with relatively intense emotion expressivity as they struggle to manage their emotions and behaviors in the classroom.},

Empirical verification of the model was conducted on a group of 1045 participants in two steps: (1) validation of the model (e.g., the circular arrangement of the metatraits, and relations with the Big Five); (2) verification of the synthesizing potential of this model by testing the predicted locations of temperamental traits, interpersonal traits, values, affects, and mental health constructs within the CPM. It has been found that the CPM can be treated as a matrix accommodating constructs described by circumplex, circular, and noncircular models.},

In the second study, schema-violations were seen as more surprising (by all individuals), decreasing intentions to approach schema-violations, but were also seen as more interesting (by those higher in openness to experience), increasing intentions to approach and accept schema-violations. This suggests that two opposing processes - appraisals of surprise and appraisals of interest - regulate reactions to schema-violations, and that these processes are bounded by individual differences in openness to experience.},

Higher levels of goal conflict are related to lower levels of positive psychological outcomes and greater psychological distress, though this relationship is stronger for distress outcomes. Other moderators that produced significant differences in effect sizes were whether a goal matrix was used to assess goal conflict, whether unipolar or bipolar assessment of goal conflict was used, and whether adult or student samples were studied.

Whereas implicit motives were supposed to predict nonverbal socializing, the corresponding explicit motives were supposed to predict verbal socializing (i.e., self-disclosure).

However, identity continuity did exhibit a slight positive association with personality stability when personality was measured using a holistic ipsative approach. Additionally, identity continuity predicted a mean-level increase in agreeableness and a mean-level decrease in neuroticism.

Exactly these tendencies are distinguished in the HEXACO model of personality, which attributes the former to Honesty-Humility (HH) and the latter to Agreeableness (AG). However, empirical dissociations between these basic traits have primarily supported the substantial and unique role of HH, whereas the picture for AG has remained somewhat inconclusive. To overcome limitations of prior studies, we introduce an economic paradigm, the Uncostly Retaliation Game, to more conclusively test the unique role of AG for forgiveness versus retaliation. In two fully incentivized experiments, we found that AG (and not HH) indeed negatively predicts retaliation decisions in the face of prior exploitation. Furthermore, the results confirm that the paradigm provides a more direct measure of retaliation (beyond individual payoff-concerns and social preferences such as inequality aversion) than previous measures and that it may thus serve future investigations into the reactive aspect of cooperation.},

Accordingly, stereotype threat might not be a major part of the explanation for the gender gap in math performance, consistent with recent meta-analyses (Flore & Wicherts, 2015).},

We compare the efficacy of these measures with surprising results: the MCSDS consistently outperforms the BIDR in identifying fakers.

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis showed that the Valuing Happiness Scale is not unidimensional and that only one of its three factors correlates negatively with various indicators of well-being, whereas non-significant or positive correlations were found for the other factors. These findings indicate that valuing happiness may not necessarily be bad for one's well-being, and call for a better definition, theoretical foundation, and operationalization of this construct.},

This study sought to replicate previous findings that adolescent pathological narcissism is linked to self-reported prosocial behavior (Kauten & Barry, 2014) and further investigated the relation of self-reported narcissism with self-, parent- and peer-reported prosocial behavior, as well as prosocial intentions, in 155 at-risk adolescents (M age = 16.8 years, SD=.77; 127 males, 28 females). Non-pathological narcissism demonstrated a positive relation with parent-reported prosocial behavior, and grandiose narcissism was positively related to both self- and parent-reported prosocial behavior. Vulnerable narcissism did not demonstrate a significant relation with any variant of prosocial behavior. Thus, the relation between adolescent narcissism and prosocial behavior appears to vary based on the dimension of narcissism and the method of assessing prosocial behavior.},

Results revealed that levels of all of the big five traits except openness were generally related to levels of social investment at work. Longitudinally, changes in social investment in work were generally associated with simultaneously co-occurring changes in only conscientiousness and agreeableness.

Agreement between the self and other rated personality profiles was studied in two samples involving 11,096 speakers of two languages, Dutch and Estonian, who completed two different personality questionnaires, the NEO-PI-3 and HEXACO-PI-R. An outstanding agreement was achieved in the most occasions: in only 4–6% of dyadic pairs was the correlation between two randomly paired profiles higher than the actually observed correlation between true pairs. As in previous studies, we found that age and sex of participants and length of acquaintance had no significant effect on the level of self-other agreement. However, intimate knowledge helped married and unmarried couples in both samples be more accurate in their personality judgments; family members, in turn, had knowledge that made them more accurate than two people who were just acquaintances or friends. We believe that these outcomes can be explained by the contention that the judgment of another's personality is a relatively simple task, which is accomplishable for most people most of the time. In other words, because judging another person's personality is an easy task, we are not able to determine “good targets,” “good judges,” or “good traits.” Perhaps it is only “good information” which determines the closeness of the target-judge relationship, and which has a small but reliable impact on the level of self-other agreement. This explains why it is so difficult to find individual differences in the ability to judge another person's personality.},

Morality is a topic of burgeoning scientific interest, and the relevance of personological factors to moral behavior has interdisciplinary implications for the social sciences, public policy, and philosophy.

The purpose of this paper is to determine whether morality is consistent across many occasions of everyday life, implying that personological factors play an important role in moral behavior. A novel method of assessing moral behaviors was developed and employed in two experience sampling studies (4075 total observations). Results showed that moral behavior is consistent in many different ways, suggesting that personological factors substantially impact moral life.},

In addition to differences between firstborns and laterborns across the entire sample, we also tested birth rank trends in a sub-sample of targets from sibships of three, raised by two parents. Overall, the average absolute association between birth order and personality traits was .02, whereas the one between birth order and intelligence was .04.},

Extending the first three studies to non-students, we found that residents of mountainous U.S. states were more introverted than residents of flat states (Study 4). In Study 5, we tested the link between introversion and the mountains experimentally by sending participants to a flat, open area or a secluded, wooded area.

Hence, the ecological correlation between state-level neuroticism and state-level life satisfaction reported in prior research is not a mere reflection of individual-level associations.

Both these individual differences were stable over time, were related to relevant personality measures, and group outcomes.

We review the relevant literature, and present and test an algebraic model that incorporates the major insights from that literature. The model posits that all person judgments reflect substance and evaluation to different extents. The evaluation component reflects an interaction between the item's evaluative tone and the perceiver's evaluative attitude regarding the target person.

However, these individual differences have remained mostly unexplained, especially in terms of traits as specified in models of basic personality structure. Theoretically, a prime candidate to account for these differences is the Honesty-Humility factor proposed as the sixth basic personality dimension within the HEXACO Model of Personality. Despite clear theoretical links, corresponding behavioral evidence is scarce and limited due to methodological caveats. In a series of six behavioral experiments we thus bridge the gap between behavioral ethics and personality research - critically testing whether individual differences in dishonest behavior can be accounted for by basic traits in general, and Honesty-Humility in particular. We implement different cheating paradigms, tasks, incentive structures, samples, and sets of covariates to evaluate the robustness and generality of results. Overall, variance in dishonest behavior was indeed accounted for by Honesty-Humility which was the only consistent predictor of cheating across the various experimental setups and beyond relevant covariates including other personality factors. The results thus corroborate that individual differences in ethical behavior can be accommodated by comprehensive models of personality structure in general and the Honesty-Humility factor in particular.},

In this article we address three levels at which people differ: within individuals, between individuals, and between groups of individuals. A dynamic model of personality is considered where traits are seen as rates of change in states in response to environmental cues. Within individuals, motivational and behavioral states show inertial properties and lead to an analysis of rates of change and latencies of behavior. Between individuals, the analysis is one of frequency and duration of choices. When individuals self select into groups reflecting shared interests and abilities, the structure of these group differences reflects the consequences of the self selection. Examples of the dynamic model are given for each level of analysis.},

Cybernetic Big Five Theory attempts to provide a comprehensive, synthetic, and mechanistic explanatory model. Constructs that describe psychological individual differences are divided into personality traits, reflecting variation in the parameters of evolved cybernetic mechanisms, and characteristic adaptations, representing goals, interpretations, and strategies defined in relation to an individual's particular life circumstances. The theory identifies mechanisms in which variation is responsible for traits in the top three levels of a hierarchical trait taxonomy based on the Big Five and describes the causal dynamics between traits and characteristic adaptations. Lastly, the theory links function and dysfunction in traits and characteristic adaptations to psychopathology and well-being.},

Third, adding an explanatory account to the Big 5 creates two parts to traits, an explanatory part and a descriptive part, and these two parts can be recognized as separate entities that are joined into whole traits. Fourth, Whole Trait Theory proposes that the explanatory side of traits consists of social-cognitive mechanisms. Fifth, social-cognitive mechanisms that produce Big-5 states should be identified.},

Personality theories largely mirror disparities between fundamental paradigms that guide most psychology: one based upon Galton's emphasis on inter-individual differences and the lexical hypothesis; the other inspired by Wundt is focused upon intra-individual processes, such as temperament and Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory. Previous integrations of personality models using these paradigms failed to account for observed variance, suggesting model incommensurability. We propose that a broader conception-developed from Cronbach and colleagues' generalisability theory-provides an effective integrating framework, and show how Galtonian and Wundtian models may be assimilated within Cronbachian approaches. Additionally, Cronbachian models have novel practical implications. Application of the Cronbachian paradigm to personality will be challenging, but provides an opportunity to achieve genuine coherence in personality research.},

The C-SAP's meta-theoretical background embodies the general principles of systems thinking and is designed to reconcile one of personality psychology cardinal concerns-personality coherence and incoherence. However, within the approach presented here one can find possible answers to the questions about definition of personality; its organization and development; a fundamental structure of personality architecture (here the System of Regulation and Integration Stimulation); explanation of personality traits (in light of their dominant function-reactive, regulative, or self-regulative-in controlling stimulation); and their usefulness in an analysis of personality coherence/incoherence, understood at this point as functional consistency/inconsistency over stimulation processing between temperament traits and other personality traits related to stimulation processing. Moreover, it is demonstrated how coherent/incoherent types of personalities are built when types of anxiety are considered as these other personality traits related to stimulation processing. Also, the methods for analyzing the functional (adaptive) significance of coherent/incoherent personality structures are shown. And finally, I present the selected results from my studies aimed at testing the functional role of personality coherence/incoherence in relation to the quality and dynamics of attentional performance.},

However, most of this work focuses exclusively on how personality influences health outcomes rather than how personality influences response to disease. Using a large, national study (. N=. 7051), we investigated whether conscientiousness and neuroticism were associated with smoking behavior after the onset of a disease. After the onset of a major chronic disease, high levels of neuroticism predicted less smoking when paired with high levels of conscientiousness, a combination described as healthy neuroticism. Healthy neuroticism only predicted smoking behavior after the onset of disease, not before, suggesting that the relationship between personality and responses to health problems differs from the relationship between personality and the onset of health problems.},

Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health showed that White Americans had significantly greater life satisfaction than all other ethnic groups in the US and this was largely due to the fact that they were the majority ethnic group; minority Americans who lived in counties where they were the numerical majority had just as much life satisfaction as White Americans did. Further, the association between ethnic composition and life satisfaction was significantly stronger among less intelligent individuals. The results suggest two important factors underlying life satisfaction and highlight the utility of integrating happiness research and evolutionary psychology.},

Adults born preterm reported similar levels of relationship satisfaction, but poorer health, life satisfaction and job satisfaction. Adults who reported having long hospital stays at birth also reported poorer health, life, relationship and job satisfaction, and this poorer well-being appeared to be accounted for, in part, by factors such as their personality.},

Many researchers have argued that higher order models of personality such as the Five Factor Model are insufficient, and that facet-level analysis is required to better understand criteria such as well-being, job performance, and personality disorders. However, common methods in the extant literature used to estimate the incremental prediction of facets over factors have several shortcomings. This paper delineates these shortcomings by evaluating alternative methods using statistical theory, simulation, and an empirical example. We recommend using differences between Olkin-Pratt adjusted r-squared for factor versus facet regression models to estimate the incremental prediction of facets and present a method for obtaining confidence intervals for such estimates using double adjusted-. r-squared bootstrapping. We also provide an R package that implements the proposed methods.},

Using data from four groups of well-acquainted students (N= 122), we investigated differential relations of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism with network centrality indicators of liking and disliking. Grandiose narcissists received a larger number of disliking nominations, indicating that they were actively disliked by their peers. In contrast, vulnerable narcissists were not actively disliked, but instead received fewer liking nominations. Both grandiose and vulnerable narcissists had a central position in terms of disliking, as they were disliked by otherwise unconnected network members. In all, these findings indicate that both forms of narcissism are unique predictors of unpopularity in peer-networks. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

We used several indices of personality similarity and tested their relations with a perceiver's experience of similarity. Similarity in the perceiver's and target's self-ratings of personality was related to experienced similarity. However, distinctive similarity (beyond the level of similarity expected between randomly paired individuals) in personality showed negligible associations with experienced similarity. Experienced similarity was strongly related to similarity in perceiver's self-ratings and their ratings of a target, and especially when that target has a personality profile that was normative or desirable. Exploratory analyses provided some indications that similarity in aspects of extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness might be particularly important to the experience of being similar. The findings thus suggest that a perceiver's experience of being similar to a target person is particularly associated with seeing the other person positively, but does not particularly indicate that one is actually much more similar to this person than chance in most circumstances unless the perceiver and target are very well-acquainted. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Further, women who had romantic partners who possessed interpersonal problems related to being overly domineering were at increased risk for experiencing high levels of relationship discord. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

However, it is well known that anger expressions can vary in intensity, ranging from mild anger to rage. To examine nPower-relevant emotional intensity processing in anger faces, an ERP oddball task with facial stimuli was utilized, with neutral expressions as the standard and targets varying on anger intensity (50%, 100%, or 150% emotive). Thirty-one college students participated in the experiment (15 low and 16 high nPower persons determined by the Picture Story Exercise, PSE). In comparison with low nPower persons, higher percentage of correct responses was observed for high nPower persons when both groups discriminated low-intensity (50% intensity) anger faces from neutral faces. ERPs between 100% and 150% anger expressions revealed that high-intensity (150%) anger expressions elicited larger P3a and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes relative to prototypical (100% intensity) anger expressions for power-motivated individuals. Conversely, low nPower participants showed no differences at both P3a and LPP components. These findings demonstrate that persons with high nPower are sensitive to intensity changes in anger faces and their sensitivity increases with the intensity of anger faces. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

As predicted, Honesty-Humility was positively associated with trustworthiness expectations. In line with the social projection hypothesis, this relation was fully mediated through cooperativeness in the Dictator Game, but not through entitlement in the Ultimatum Game.

Data stem from the Parent-Child Socialization Study (2012), a representative sample among adolescents and both their parents in Belgium. Controlling for the mediating mechanisms, no direct relationship between parental cross-group friendship and adolescents' prejudice was found. Parental cross-group friendships was, however, indirectly related via parent-child anti-immigrant prejudice and cross-group friendship similarity.

After adjustment for measurement error, more than half the total variance in EMA reports of anxiety and anger/hostility is attributable to stable trait-like individual differences; however, the trait-like component of each construct is only modestly correlated with questionnaire measures of that construct. The 6-month "test-retest" correlations of latent variables representing the true 24-h EMA average anxiety and average anger are quite high ( r≥ 0.83). This study represents the longest follow-up period over which EMA-based estimates of traits have been examined.

Regardless of reporting method, Honesty-Humility and Guilt Proneness were correlated with delinquency, unethical decision making, and counterproductive work behavior, suggesting that unethical behavior is committed disproportionately by people with low levels of these character traits. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Dispositional optimism is typically conceptualized as a generalized tendency to expect positive personal future outcomes. The subjective future, however, does not exist in a temporal vacuum. Based on a temporally-expanded perspective, in three studies we evaluated the association between dispositional optimism and temporal orientation, operationalized as momentary and habitual temporal focus (past, present, future) and temporal life evaluations (recollected past, present, anticipated future). Dispositional optimism was not associated uniquely with momentary thoughts about the personal future, habitual focus on the personal future, or positive anticipated outcomes. Instead, dispositional optimism was linked with a generalized tendency to evaluate personal outcomes positively regardless of temporal perspective. The present work thus demonstrates the value of situating dispositional optimism within a temporally-expanded landscape. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

High-alexithymic subjects produced fewer different types of emotions words and fewer synonyms for a target emotion than low-alexithymics indicating that the diversity of the semantic space of emotion words is reduced in alexithymia. Interestingly, compared to low-alexithymics high-alexithymic subjects reported fewer symptomatic, physiological-expressive terms to describe emotions. This result suggests that experiential aspects of the proposed emotion schemata in alexithymics are less differentiated, supporting the idea of a difficulty in emotion conceptualization. © 2013.},

These findings are consistent with the position that individual differences in religiosity are mediated through biological systems involved in meeting both social and existential needs, although further work is required to determine directions of causal action. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

For scales where this was the case, participants' membership to NERS or ERS on each scale was entered into a latent class analysis (LCA). For both instruments, this second order LCA revealed that the response style was consistent for the majority of the participants across latent variables. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Finally, felt understanding in everyday life accounted for the mean difference in life satisfaction between Asians and Caucasians. However, the Asian-Caucasian difference in life satisfaction and felt understanding could be due to general positivity or negativity. We thus statistically controlled for extraversion and neuroticism. Controlling for extraversion and neuroticism, felt understanding still mediated the Asian-Caucasian difference in life satisfaction. © 2013.},

Specifically, we expected measures of "anxiety" to be lower and measures of "euphoria" to be higher in high trait reappraising individuals. Our findings that trait reappraisal is negatively correlated with stress reactivity as measured by cortisol, heart rate, and self-report state anxiety, but positively correlated with self-report state euphoria suggest that individuals high in trait reappraisal are more stress resilient. © 2012.},

In four studies, conservatives expressed greater personal agency (e.g., personal control, responsibility), more positive outlook (e.g., optimism, self-worth), more transcendent moral beliefs (e.g., greater religiosity, greater moral clarity, less tolerance of transgressions), and a generalized belief in fairness, and these differences accounted for the happiness gap.

  abstract = {This research reports about asymmetrical relations in self-other ratings of attachment style. Specifically, results showed that romantic partners hold relatively accurate perceptions of each other's attachment styles with one exception: women's ability to judge their male partner's level of attachment-related anxiety was compromised compared with the other agreement indices measured. The effect was not moderated by acquaintanceship length or relationship satisfaction, but it was affected by men's interpersonally oriented self-control. The findings appear to reflect men's reluctance from appearing anxious to their female partners and from the nature of the anxiety dimension of attachment. Anxiety (as compared with avoidance) has a less consistent interpersonal behavioral manifestation and thus is more concealable among those motivated and capable of doing so. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Toward this end, three studies are presented. Specifically, Study 1 examined relationships between a frequency-based measure of the Big Five personality traits and several motivational variables. Study 2 examined the moderating role of temporal consistency information (provided by frequency-based measurement) on relationships between personality and peer ratings of task performance. Study 3 compared the frequency-based measure to a Likert-type measure with respect to each measure's susceptibility to deliberate response distortion. Results indicated that consistency information increases the predictive validity of agreeableness and conscientiousness and that a frequency-based format is less susceptible to faking than a Likert-type format for conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Extraversion is found important to initial perceptions of intra-group influence, which is partially mediated by peer-perceived social-emotional usefulness. After a few months, reputations are established and everyone has met; now work needs to get done efficiently and accurately and cognitive ability predicts increases in perceived group influence, which is partially mediated by perceived intelligence. After even more time, other Big Five personality traits become important to changes in perceived group influence, with positive associations with openness to experience, and negative associations with neuroticism and conscientiousness.

In Study 2, a sample of 86 women reported their interpersonal styles during each day of their menstrual cycle. Results indicated that men tended to prefer mates who were interpersonally warm and that women tended to become more interpersonally warm during periods of high fertility. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Narcissism was assessed on three occasions, from age 34 to age 59. Hypersensitive narcissism was found to decrease, Autonomous narcissism increased, and Willfulness narcissism did not change with age. At age 34, both Willfulness and Autonomous narcissism were related to agentic personality characteristics, but only Autonomous narcissism was related to the communal personality characteristic of empathy. Change in narcissism between age 34 and age 59 was shown to predict change in personality at age 71. The agentic personality characteristics that had been associated with Willfulness narcissism at age 34 were no longer characteristic of those individuals at age 71. In addition, in contrast to Autonomous narcissism, at age 34 Willfulness and Hypersensitivity were associated with emotional maladjustment, and predicted continuing maladjustment and less favorable life outcomes in later life. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Meta-analytic results revealed that a subset of NPI items were indeed problematic; items that function poorly at differentiating narcissists from non-narcissists accounted entirely for the NPI's connection to psychological health. These items were also strongly associated with self-esteem, but unrelated to aggression/anger. In contrast, the remaining NPI items were unrelated to psychological health, but associated with aggression/anger. We conclude that although the NPI measures narcissism, its poorest functioning items also link it to outcomes unrelated to narcissism. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Using Haidt et al.'s Moral Foundations Questionnaire, 222 adult male offenders assessed for clinical psychopathy reported their degree of support for five moral domains: Harm Prevention, Fairness, Respect for Authority, Ingroup Loyalty, and Purity/Sanctity. As predicted, psychopathy total score explained a substantial proportion of the variance in reduced support for Harm Prevention and Fairness, but not the other domains. These results confirm that psychopathy entails a discrete set of moral abnormalities and suggest that these abnormalities could potentially help to explain the characteristic antisocial behavior of individuals with psychopathy. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In this paper, we report two experience-sampling studies employing cell-phone text-messaging aimed at further exploring individual differences in affective experience. Results showed that within-person relationships between energetic arousal and tense arousal ranged from de-synchrony to synchrony, but that within-person relationships between Pleasant and Unpleasant affect varied from strong de-synchrony to weak de-synchrony. Individual differences in within-person EA-TA associations were related to perceiving threatening situations as incentives and to interactions between affective traits. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

This study evaluated the reliability of extracting data from the interests and activities sections of Facebook profiles, linking them to general personality and Sensational Interests Questionnaire (SIQ) scores. Data from 694 user profiles (N= 352 males) were linked to the Big Five personality traits, age, and educational attainment. Three independent raters coded the number of sensational topics reported by a user in each section. In Poisson regression analyses, higher SIQ Violent Occultism scores predicted a larger count of sensational interests, and sensational activities in males only. Higher SIQ Militarism scores predicted a larger number of sensational interests in males, but a smaller number in females. Although the number of sensational interests reported by social networking users on their personal profiles is potentially informative, further research should investigate gender differences, and why females with greater Militarism scores are less likely to report what these specific interests are. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Undergraduates (n= 936) completed the 14-item measure of authentic and hubristic pride (Tracy & Robins, 2007b) and a battery of other self-report measures. The two types of pride correlated with distinct profiles of goal-regulation tendencies, affective tendencies, and self-control. Authentic pride correlated with measures of self-control, whereas hubristic pride was related to measures of impulsivity and aggression. Overall, the differential pattern of correlations fits with a model in which authentic pride is tied to adaptive achievement and goal engagement, whereas hubristic pride is tied to extrinsic values of public recognition and social dominance. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Participants were 534 at-risk adolescents ages 16-19, attending a military-style residential program. Psychopathy-linked narcissism was positively associated with self-reported internalizing problems; however, narcissism assessed from the Narcissistic Personality Inventory for Children (NPIC; Barry, Frick, & Killian, 2003) was negatively associated with such symptoms. Perceptions of peer relationships appeared to play a role in this latter association. The implications for the understanding of youth narcissism are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Subsequent increased accessibility of positive self-information, only shown by narcissists, indicates that their desire for self-worth is hard to fulfill.

This view is challenged in the current paper, using a sample of 672 participants in the age range of 18-87. years who described their own personality and were judged by an external observer who knew them well, using the NEO PI-3 questionnaire (McCrae, Costa, & Martin, 2005). The self-observer agreement on the 30 personality subscales varied from .38 (O3: Feelings) to .57 (E5: Excitement Seeking). Approximately one-half of the variance in the agreement level was explained by the standard deviation of the sum scores of these subscales: self-observer agreement was higher in the subscales on which individual differences were larger. After correction for the range of variance, differences in self-observer agreement substantially diminished. It is proposed that judges who know each other well reach an approximately equal level of agreement on all the Big Five personality traits. © 2010.},

After 3. years of unemployment individuals high in conscientiousness (i.e. one standard deviation above the mean) experience a 120% higher decrease in life satisfaction than those at low levels. Thus the positive relationship typically seen between conscientiousness and well-being is reversed: conscientiousness is therefore not always good for well-being. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Both mothers and fathers reported on attributes of their child using subscales from the Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire, the Child Behavior Questionnaire, and the Iowa Personality Questionnaire. Reports were used as indicators of the latent " Big Three" dimensions of positive emotionality, negative emotionality, and constraint at each of the three developmental periods.

The mean personality profiles of the typical Russian converged significantly with self-rated personality traits (r=.63, p<.01), but not with observer-ratings (r=.33, p=.08). However, the former correlation lost its significance when the mean ratings of an ideal person ratings were controlled for (r=.35, p=.06). The mean ratings of a typical Russian converged even more substantially with the personality profile of an ideal person (r=.71, p<.001). Overall, the results suggest that the portrait of a typical Russian may to some extent be based on actual personality dispositions of Russians, but it is more likely that this portrait reflects socially desirable personality traits that have been attributed to a typical Russian.

There was, however, a significant indirect relationship through externalization of blame, but mostly when aggression was measured using self-report. Guilt-proneness, on the other hand, showed a direct negative relationship to aggression whether using self-report or other reports of aggression. Guilt was also inversely related to aggression indirectly through externalization of blame and empathy.

A factor analysis led to a four-factor solution; factors were defined as Interpersonal Strengths, Fortitude, Vitality, and Cautiousness. Of these factors, Vitality (with zest, hope, curiosity, and humor as indicators) emerged as the most relevant to well-being. When examining individual strengths, zest, curiosity, gratitude, and optimism/hope emerged with the strongest associations with elevated life satisfaction, subjective vitality, satisfaction of autonomy, relatedness, and competence needs, and a pleasurable, engaging, and meaningful existence. Results have implications for understanding the structure and variability of benefits linked with particular strengths. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

Neither demographic variables (sex, ethnicity, education, and secular trends), nor the standing on the five major dimensions of personality, were predictors of change in trait stability.

Analyzing a sample of 719, we found that the Drive component was uniquely connected with Functional Impulsivity, and Fun Seeking was linked to both impulsivities, but more weakly so to Functional Impulsivity compared with Drive. Reward Responsiveness was unrelated to Impulsivity. Implications for the conceptualization of Functional Impulsivity and for a complex view of BAS-related functions are addressed. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In two additional samples (ns = 150 and 119), we cross-validated this factor structure and provided initial evidence for construct validity. This includes positive correlations with personal growth, openness to experience, autonomy, purpose in life, self-acceptance, psychological flexibility, positive affect, and positive social relations, among others. Applying item response theory (IRT) to these samples (n = 578), we showed that the items have good discrimination and a desirable breadth of difficulty.

Emotionally investing tendencies were also associated with fertility and sexual promiscuity levels, though these nation-level links were not always consistent with evolutionary perspectives.

Need for power was assessed via the Picture Story Exercise [PSE; McClelland, D. C., Koestner, R., & Weinberger, J. (1989). How do self-attributed and implicit motives differ? Psychological Review, 96, 690-702] and analyzed by means of the coding system developed by David Winter [Winter, D. G. (1973). The power motive. New York: Free Press; Smith, C. P. (Ed.). (1992).

The power-stress induction assumed the form of negative reaction by an audience of two persons to an extemporaneous speech. Conceived in this way, the power-stress manipulation represents a different operational definition of power stress than has characterized previous studies. As such, the investigation is an attempt to enlarge McClelland's concept to explain a broader set of circumstances. In the control condition, audience reaction was supportive and favorable, but not to an extreme. Half the research participants scored high on the PSE measure of power motivation, and half scored low. Half were women, and half were men. Persons high in power motivation displayed more negative affect to the negative audience reaction to their speech than did persons low in power motivation, and higher than both high- and low-power persons in the control condition as indexed by electromyographic readings from the brow supercilii (p < .05) and by Anxiety scores (p < .05) on the Affect Balance Scale [Downey, G., & Feldman, S.

Study 1 revealed that mindfulness was associated with a smaller financial desire discrepancy, which helped explain a positive association between mindfulness and SWB in undergraduates. Two further studies with working adults showed that these results occurred independently of financial status and changes therein. A final, quasi-experimental study with mindfulness trainees extended these findings. Reasons why mindfulness may help to promote the perception of having "enough" are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Participants were primed by viewing images of violence or prosocial behavior immediately before completing the LDT. Psychopathy was unrelated to emotion processing in the positive image condition, however, following exposure to violent imagery, emotional detachment (F1), but not social deviance (F2) predicted decreased processing of sadness words. This deficit mediated the relationship between F1 and proactive aggression.

Similarly, attempts to link testosterone changes to a situational outcome like winning or losing a dominance contest have yielded inconsistent findings. However, research has consistently shown that an indirect measure of an individual's dominance disposition, implicit power motivation, is positively related to baseline testosterone levels and, in interaction with situational outcomes, predicts testosterone changes. We propose a hormonal model of implicit power motivation that describes how testosterone levels change as an interactive function of individuals' implicit power motivation and dominance situations. We also propose that estradiol, and not testosterone, plays a key role in dominance motivation in women. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In fact, some multi-level models have stressed the differences between traits, which are the most generic and decontextualized units of analysis, and middle-level units, which are more closely related to motivational processes and more contextualized in time, space or specific roles. Personal strivings, which are defined as what people typically intend to do, hold a prominent place among middle-level units. Nevertheless, surprisingly little is still known about the relationship between traits and striving dimensions; likewise, little is known about the inter-relationships between traits, strivings and well-being. In this study, we used the NEO-PI-R, Personal Striving Assessment Packet (PSAP) and various well-being measures (viz., positive affect, negative affect, satisfaction with life and purpose in life) on a sample of 405 adults. We found Neuroticism and Extraversion to be related to perceived efficacy in the struggle for strivings; Extraversion, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness to relate to striving intensity dimensions, and a variety of striving dimensions to be significantly related to well-being. A joint analysis of traits, strivings and well-being revealed that traits may indirectly affect well-being via specific striving dimensions, although the mediational effects are slight and both traits and strivings appear to make separate significant contributions to the prediction of well-being. Broadly speaking, the results suggest that units of analysis originating from rather disparate traditions should be integrated in order to develop a consilient view of personality levels. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Using proportional hazards (Cox) models we found that one health behavior, smoking, attenuated the effect of neuroticism on mortality by 40%.

We created five a priori preschool scales anticipated to foretell future narcissism. Independent assessors evaluated the participants' personality at ages 14, 18, and 23. Based upon these evaluations, we generated observer-based narcissism scales for each of these three ages. All preschool scales predicted subsequent narcissism, except Interpersonal Antagonism at age 23. According to mean scale and item scores analyses, narcissism increased significantly from age 14 to 18, followed by a slight but non-significant decline from age 18 to 23. The discussion focused on a developmental view of narcissism, the need for research on automatic processing and psychological defenses, and links between narcissism and attachment.},

Those high in Honesty-Humility, on the other hand, displayed a stable tendency for choosing a more fair solution - even when they could have defected without fearing consequences. Finally, social value orientations were shown to partially mediate the effects found. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Using regression analyses, we tested whether repressors report negative personal events at reduced levels of specificity, as suggested by affect regulation accounts. Participants (N = 82) wrote brief descriptions of personal memories and imagined future experiences as prompted by emotionally negative cues. Participants rated these events for emotional intensity and importance before completing measures of defensiveness, trait anxiety and depressive symptoms. Defensiveness was associated with reduced accessibility of negative self-relevant material but, contrary to Weinberger et al.'s typology, this effect was not moderated by self-reported anxiety. Defensiveness functioned as a suppressor variable such that its inclusion in regression analyses yielded significant negative relationships between anxiety or depressive symptoms and event specificity, even though zero-order correlations between these variables and specificity were non-significant. Results suggest that research based on Weinberger et al.'s classification may underestimate the role of defensiveness in repressive coping and that researchers should consider measuring defensiveness when investigating the relationship between psychopathology and self-relevant cognition. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This experiential mode of processing suggests implications for the perception of and response to stress situations. Using laboratory-based, longitudinal, and daily diary designs, four studies examined the role of mindfulness on appraisals of and coping with stress experiences in college students, and the consequences of such stress processing for well-being. Across the four studies (n's = 65 - 141), results demonstrated that mindful individuals made more benign stress appraisals, reported less frequent use of avoidant coping strategies, and in two studies, reported higher use of approach coping. In turn, more adaptive stress responses and coping partially or fully mediated the relation between mindfulness and well-being. Implications for the role of mindfulness in stress and well-being are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This research proposes that people's affective reactions to and preferences for these characters in rich cultural media-their "resonance" to archetypes-may be an indicator of their own personality and life themes. In the first of two studies, a Rich Culture Archetype Scale (RCAS) was constructed based on media examples from popular music, movies, and classic art representing certain archetypes. In the second study, the RCAS was compared with other scales of personality and of archetypes. Results indicated that there exist five clusters of archetypes to which people resonate, and that people's resonance predicts their personal life themes and media preferences. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The high frequency of a critical discrepancy between desired and actual affect is assumed to foster affect regulation. Using three independent samples and different approaches to assess affect, desired affect and affective discrepancy were investigated together with personality, self-efficacy in affect regulation, life satisfaction, and depression. Apart from a general hedonistic motivation, we observed a meaningful interindividual variation in desired affect and affective discrepancy.

During this time, the prevailing assumption has been that an adult's attachment style is a relatively stable disposition, rooted in internal working models of self and relationship partners. These models are based on previous experiences in close relationships. Recent research, however, suggests that levels of attachment anxiety, avoidance, and security are also affected by situational factors. To capture temporary fluctuations in the sense of attachment security and insecurity we developed a state adult attachment measure (SAAM). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses yielded three reliable subscales measuring state levels of attachment-related anxiety, avoidance, and security. Additional studies demonstrated both convergent and discriminant validity of the new measure, and its sensitivity to a variety of experimental manipulations. Our discussion focuses on potential uses for the SAAM for both researchers and clinicians. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Participants recorded their own social behavior (dominant, agreeable, submissive, quarrelsome) in four situations defined by the perceived social behavior of their primary interaction partners (agreeable-dominant, agreeable-submissive, quarrelsome-submissive, quarrelsome-dominant). Although interpersonal signatures demonstrated a normative within-person organization that closely corresponded to the structure of the interpersonal circle, individual differences were also found. The idiographic signatures of individuals differed along two nomothetically interpretable dimensions, polarity and orthogonality, that were distinct from other dimensions of personality (the Big Five) but were related to socio-emotional adjustment (depression, self-esteem). © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The internecine war over the relative importance of persons and situations, triggered 40 years ago by Walter Mischel's Personality and Assessment, is largely over, so it is time for researchers to develop an agenda for personality psychology in the postwar era. The possibilities include a return to the status quo ante characterized by questionnaire-based research, focusing on narrower trait constructs than the "global" traits that have undergone so much criticism, and concentrating upon within-person variance (as well as or even instead of between person variance) in behavior. Each of these possibilities offers some promise but also hazards that may be under-appreciated. The present article suggests that personality theory and research be re-organized in terms of the personality triad of persons, behaviors, and situations. A precondition for understanding the elements of this triad is better conceptualization and measurement of behavior and, especially, situations. While the interactions among these elements may turn out to be important, a first order of business is to understand the main effects of each element, a formidable but exciting research agenda that will entail a turn to broadly descriptive research rather than the testing of narrow, isolated hypotheses. Looking further ahead, a post-interactionist personality psychology may someday recognize that personality is a latent construct only indirectly indicated through behavior, and the ultimate understanding of that construct will be empirically tested by the ability to predict behavior in new and unique situations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We discuss both the long-term processes involved in the transformation of personality traits as a function of roles, as well as the micro-level processes that occur in people's daily lives, linking social roles, short-term goals, and personality states.

  abstract = {It is likely that many contemporary personality psychologists would say that the person-situation debate is over. We agree that most of the empirical issues that ignited the debate have been resolved (and were probably resolved by the late 1970s). In fact, we acknowledge that many psychologists will find continued discussion of this debate to be quite tiresome. Yet in spite of this wide agreement, tensions still run high. It seems that there is less agreement about how and why the debate ended, whether it was ultimately productive, and how the field should move forward. Given that the major empirical issues have been resolved, we are left with the impression that when psychologists talk about the "person-situation debate" they are really talking about issues that are related to many different debates, and the conflation of various debates prevents a complete resolution to the issues. We also believe that deeper philosophical issues also contribute to the tensions in the debate. When putting together this special issue, we had hoped to be able to disentangle the various dimensions of the person-situation debate and to isolate those that remain contentious 40 years after the publication of Personality and Assessment. Our ultimate goal in this respect was to facilitate future discussion and to prevent psychologists from talking past one another when discussing these issues that are so critical for our field. In this essay, we have attempted to take a preliminary step in the direction of clarifying these issues. Our insights are not novel and we certainly do not believe that the dimensions of the debate that we identified are comprehensive or complete. However, we hope they highlight the fact that some subtler issues may be intertwined with or may have resulted from the person-situation debate and these underlying issues may remain a primary source of negative affect among many of those involved. Can a debate really be over if the feelings are still raw? Perhaps the negative affect that remains simply results from lingering personal wounds that have yet to heal. Yet we also believe that many young psychologists who were far removed from academic psychology in the 1970s and 1980s have strong reactions to these issues, and therefore this "life history" explanation may not account for all of the negativity. Indeed, we believe that it is more likely that there are deeper issues that remain unresolved. Perhaps this is naïve, but it seems to us that the debate will be over not just when psychologists are willing to say it is over, but when we can talk about all of the issues without experiencing high levels negative affect. It seems that greater precision and clarity regarding the underlying debates is needed before this goal can be achieved. It is also potentially useful to recognize that the person-situation debate involves issues that transcend scientific concerns, a fact which may perpetuate affective reactions and prevent a complete resolution of the issues. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Most coaches exhibited stable and idiographically distinctive situation-behavior patterns in both their supportive and instructional behaviors across winning, losing, and tied/close half-innings. Although overall rates of supportive, punitive, and instructional behaviors accounted for little variance in athletes' liking for the coach, specific situation-behavior contingencies (e.g., if winning, then supportive; if losing, then punitive) were significantly related to children's attitudes towards these coaches, whereas others (e.g., punitive while winning, supportive while losing) were not. Consistent with theoretical expectations based on Mischel's cognitive social learning reconceptualization of personality, contextualized behaviors were stable and more highly related to the interpersonal liking variable than were decontextualized behavior aggregates. © 2009.},

The answers to these questions and the resulting classes of the typology relate to a broad range of concepts and theoretical frameworks, including synergistic interactions, ability accounts of personality dispositions, stress-diathesis models within the psychopathology domain, individual differences in discriminative facility, and Traits As Situational Sensitivities models. Tools from the two-mode clustering domain (old as well as recently proposed ones) can be used to detect the type of individual differences structure that constitutes the gist of a person by situation data set at hand.

When with other people, they were likely to be in bigger, less intimate groups and to feel asocial.

Using the 10 resulting CPI-AB5C circumplexes as starting points, 16 facet scales were then developed to assess specific personality characteristics within the broad Big Five domains. Finally, principal components analysis with validimax rotation was used to score the five domains from the facet scales. In three independent samples, the resulting CPI-Big Five measure demonstrated strong reliability, convergence with self- and peer-reports, and discriminant validity. Availability of the new measure brings more than a half-century's worth of archival CPI data to bear on contemporary research questions about the Big Five.

Extending Heine et al.'s work, we examined the validity of self-reported Big Five personality traits as well as life satisfaction and self-esteem, using weighted regression. Consistent with Heine et al., self-reported conscientiousness showed a severe lack of validity. However, self-reported agreeableness, neuroticism, self-esteem, and life satisfaction showed predictable associations with the criterion variables. It appears, therefore, premature to dismiss self-reports of personality traits and well-being as meaningless. Accordingly, it is important to examine the validity of self-reported personality, self-esteem, and life satisfaction using nationally representative samples in order to clarify which variables are vulnerable to the reference-group effect and other self-reporting biases. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Experiment 1 indicated that extraversion accounted for variations in intentionality judgments, controlling for a range of other general individual differences (e.g. working memory, self-control). Experiment 2 indicated that extraversion's influence was partially mediated by more specific variations in intentional action concepts. A priming manipulation also provided causal evidence of judgment instability and bias. Results suggest that the intentional action judgment asymmetry is multiply determined, reflecting the interplay of individual differences and judgment biases.

Particularly for negative events, people fail to consider how coping resources will ameliorate negative affect, a phenomenon termed immune neglect. In an affective forecasting study of nine football games, participants (n = 180) overestimated emotional reactions to wins and losses, and an experimental manipulation helped reduce bias. Further, those reporting greater use of emotional processing coping strategies recovered more effectively from losses, but failed to foresee this when making predictions, leading to increased bias. This is the first study to document individual differences in immune neglect. Results support the generalizability of biased predictions and contribute to the understanding of affective forecasting and coping. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Studies consistently show that the correlation between income and well-being is small. This evidence has been interpreted to mean that money does not matter and that people's intuitions about the causes of happiness are wrong. However, correlation coefficients are notoriously difficult to interpret, and thus it is possible that lay people's intuitions are correct, whereas psychologists' interpretation of correlation coefficients is wrong. Data from two large-scale studies replicate the relatively weak correlation between income and happiness. However, both studies show that these small correlations translate into large mean differences between rich and poor groups. These mean differences are medium in size even when the wealthy are compared to average. In addition, measurement error has negligible effects on the correlation coefficient, but has strong effects on the rich/poor happiness gap. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This prediction was confirmed in both a novel non-contingent-success setting (Study 1) and a more realistic contingent-success setting (Study 2). We suggest that to achieve a strong and clear indication of behavioral self-handicapping, researchers consider effort expenditure, as it is less susceptible to alternative explanations than effort withdrawal.

The results corroborate this hypothesis: neuroticism predicted participants' adherence to the RH while the other Big 5 factors and intelligence yielded no additional explanatory power. Moreover, the effect of neuroticism was not mediated by the accessibility of knowledge thus lending preliminary support for the notion that this effect may, in fact, be genuinely motivational in nature. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Aiming to replicate and further explore this finding, the present study investigated how two dimensions of perfectionism (high standards, discrepancy between expectations and performance) predicted efficiency in proof-reading performance. N = 96 students completed a proof-reading task involving the detection of spelling, grammar, and format errors. When error-detection performance was subjected to signal detection analysis, high standards correlated positively with the number of incorrectly detected errors (false alarms). Moreover, when task-completion time was taken into account, high standards were negatively correlated with efficiency (accuracy/time). In comparison, discrepancy correlated negatively with the number of correctly detected errors (hits) and positively with a conservative response bias. The findings show that perfectionistic standards are associated with reduced efficiency demonstrating the importance of considering invested time, errors, and response bias when investigating the relationship between perfectionism and performance. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, the effects of both autonomy and sociotropy on sociability were partially mediated by domain-specific attachment in domain-congruent (romantic) but not domain-incongruent (non-romantic) relational contexts: romantic avoidance partially mediated the effects of autonomy on sociability toward romantic partners, whereas romantic anxiety partially mediated the effects of sociotropy. These results suggest that autonomy and sociotropy summarize global regularities in relational responding that correspond to those described by attachment avoidance and anxiety-although (unlike attachment) they do so across relational contexts. Domain-specific attachment representations, in contrast, govern responding within context-congruent domains and act as a mechanism through which personality guides social interaction within these domains. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Despite this fundamental aspect of narcissism, little is known about whether narcissism is manifested in features of physical appearance. Can you tell if someone is narcissistic just by looking at them? Our results indicate that snap judgments of narcissism based on full-body photographs are at least as accurate as snap judgments of any of the big five personality traits. Narcissists are more likely to wear expensive, flashy clothing, have an organized, neat appearance requiring a lot of preparation, and (in females) wear makeup and show cleavage. Furthermore, observers' judgments correlate with the presence of these cues, suggesting that they are drawing on the correct information when making their judgments. Finally, observers' judgments are associated with three of the four facets of narcissism and capture the unique constellation of personality traits typical of narcissists (i.e., high extraversion and low agreeableness). These findings suggest that physical appearance reflects narcissists' personality, preoccupation with good looks, and desire to be the center of attention, and serves as a vehicle with which to promote their status. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

Whether self-evaluations captured via "implicit" measures actually have these functional properties requires empirical verification, however. This investigation critically examined the evidence for such assumptions regarding the Name-Letter Test, one of the most popular implicit measures, by adopting a phenomenological approach. The results revealed that many respondents were aware of the self-relevant nature of the measure at the time of assessment. Moreover, at least some variance in the "implicit" measurement outcomes was accounted for by relevant conscious beliefs, particularly among those aware of the self-relevant nature of the task.

Recent observations in corporate settings suggest that enhanced interpersonal assessments might underlie this process, giving psychopathic individuals the ability to detect useful and/or vulnerable victims. To test this hypothesis, a non-forensic sample of males participated in a social memory experiment involving the recognition of faces and recalling the biographical details of artificially created characters differing in their relative career success and emotional vulnerability. High-psychopathy participants had near-perfect recognition for sad, unsuccessful female characters, but impaired memory for other characters. The findings suggest that psychopathic personality is associated with "predatory memory" even in the absence of overt criminality. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Study 1 revealed that these disgusts are particularly associated with neuroticism and behavioral inhibition. Moreover, the three disgusts showed a theoretically consistent pattern of relations on four disgust-relevant behavioral avoidance tasks in Study 2. Similar results were found in Study 3 such that core disgust was significantly related to increased physiological responding during exposure to vomit, while animal-reminder disgust was specifically related to physiological responding during exposure to blood. Lastly, Study 4 revealed that each of the three disgusts showed a different pattern of relations with fear of contamination, fear of animals, and fear of blood-injury relevant stimuli. These findings provide support for the convergent and divergent validity of core, animal-reminder, and contamination disgust. These findings also highlight the possibility that the three kinds of disgust may manifest as a function of different psychological mechanisms (i.e., oral incorporation, mortality defense, disease avoidance) that may give rise to different clinical conditions. However, empirical examination of the mechanisms that underlie the three disgusts will require further refinement of the psychometric properties of the disgust scale. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Individuals participated in three assessment sessions. Personal beliefs about reasons for using humor were assessed either idiographically or with respect to a nomothetic system of humor-related reasons for action. The subjective relevance of nomothetically- and idiographically-identified reasons to everyday social situations was assessed. Subsequently, participants reported their perceived likelihood of using humor in specific social contexts. As predicted, likelihood of humor use varied substantially as a function of the relevance of situations to idiographically-identified reasons, but did not vary as a function of the relevance of situations to reasons identified nomothetically.

Specifically, extraversion was conceptualized as individual differences in the activation of reward system in social situations, agreeableness as differences in the motivation to cooperate (vs. acting selfishly) in resource conflicts, conscientiousness as differences in the tenacity of goal pursuit under distracting circumstances, neuroticism as differences in the activation of the punishment system when faced with cues of social exclusion, and openness for experiences as differences in the activation of reward system when engaging in cognitive activity. We devised a questionnaire that is consistent with these motivational conceptualizations. This questionnaire turned out to differ from an established FFM questionnaire in terms of content but it did not interfere with the factorial, structural, and predictive validity of the FFM.

  abstract = {Three facets of the mindfulness/acceptance spectrum have been investigated in 134 experienced paramedics exposed to a number of potentially traumatic events. The contribution of (1) experiential avoidance, (2) mindful awareness and (3) meta-emotions in psychological well-being and satisfaction with life was analysed. Changes in these variables due to experiencing highly stressful incidents were explored by comparing experts with 105 novices. With accumulating experience, experiential avoidance remained stable, mindful awareness markedly increased at first and declined thereafter. Both positive and negative meta-emotions decreased with the number of stressful incidents. Experiential avoidance and meta-emotions explained 62% of the variance in psychological well-being, and patterns indicate that non-acceptance of thoughts and emotions might not be generally detrimental in this sample. Being stern and contemptuous about one's own feelings and having little self-compassion has been found to be beneficial for psychological well-being in these experts. Although this is contrary to contemporary theorizing it might perfectly reflect the role of paramedics and their need for control. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The As-If-Scale (AIS), a trait measure of histrionic self-presentation, shows good internal consistency and test-retest reliability as well as convergent and discriminant validity in several samples. Construct validation involved determining relations between the AIS and the Big Five, histrionic role concepts, motives, competencies, humor and ambivalence. Furthermore, the AIS yielded incremental validity in predicting behaviors related to histrionic self-presentation over and above the self-monitoring construct. The possible impact of the histrionic style for research on self-presentation and other fields is discussed. It is argued that histrionic phenomena are pervasive within many facets of our western culture and therefore deserve further examination. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The data showed that, although on average pleasure and arousal were independent, within-person pleasure-arousal associations substantially varied and ranged from strongly positive to strongly negative. This finding demonstrates that pleasant/unpleasant feelings usually co-occur with high arousal for some (reflecting joy/stress), but with low arousal for others (reflecting relaxation/sadness) and that persons differ in whether arousal is usually pleasant or unpleasant. These differences were found to be related to dispositional reward responsiveness, with high reward responsive individuals being characterized by a positive relation between pleasure and arousal and vice versa. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Results from two studies with dating couples are consistent with this model.

Based on evolutionary models of human mating, we predicted that self-esteem should be more attuned to self-perceived mate value in men (when compared to women) who pursue short-term mating tactics, especially if they are unsuccessful therein. In a web-based study (N = 2670), we found that mate value self-perceptions had a stronger effect on self-esteem on those who had less short-term mating success in the past. However, being in a committed relationship or parenthood reduced the impact of mate value self-perceptions. As expected, these effects were specific to men. These results are suggestive of a psychological mechanism based on adaptive sociometer attunements that could help men to choose their optimal mating tactic and might thus partly explain intrasexual differences in sociosexuality. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Findings indicate that a prevention-focused style of self-regulation is associated with aggressiveness and suggest that endorsement of (negative) reciprocity norms and sensitivity to norm violations are relevant factors that help explain the differences in aggressiveness observed among individuals with a predominantly prevention-focused style of self-regulation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

To help sort out the disparities, we examined four potential moderators of the enhancement-adjustment association in 123 college students. First was the method of operationalizing self-enhancement, that is, social comparison (rating oneself more positively than one rates others) vs. criterion discrepancy (rating oneself more positively than one is rated by others). Second was the motivational domain of the operationalization-agentic vs. communal attributes. Third was the evaluator of adjustment-self-rating vs. peer ratings. Fourth was the facet of adjustment-personal adjustment (e.g., self-esteem, happiness) vs. interpersonal adjustment (e.g., harmonious social relations). With peer-rated adjustment as the criterion, the social comparison operationalization was associated with better adjustment whereas the discrepancy operationalization was associated with maladjustment. Both operationalizations of self-enhancement were positively associated with self-reported personal adjustment. When trait variance was partialed out, the social comparison index lost its predictive power, but the discrepancy index held up. Motivational domain and adjustment facet played significant but more complex roles in the enhancement-adjustment association. Our firmest conclusion is that the social comparison index is not an appropriate measure of self-enhancement. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Using data from American (N = 1183) and Japanese (N = 982) young adults, mean levels and correlates of presence of meaning and search for meaning were examined. As predicted, Americans reported greater presence of meaning; Japanese reported greater search for meaning. In accordance with the model, search for meaning was negatively related to presence of meaning and well-being in the United States (opposed) and positively related to these variables in Japan (harmonious). Thus, the search for meaning appears to be influenced by culture, and search for meaning appears to moderate cultural influences on presence of meaning. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Personality differences at the levels of traits and ego development were examined in relation to autobiographical reasoning. One hundred and nineteen younger and older adults completed a self-defining memory interview. Self-event connections reported in the interviews were coded as being about dispositions, values, outlook, and personal growth. Connections were then coded for the degree of cognitive effort required to make the connection and the emotional evaluation of the connection. Finally, the entire interview was coded for the presence or absence of a theme. Results showed that cognitive effort and evaluation differed across type of connection, and ego development and traits moderated some of these results. Further, across connections, there were individual differences in cognitive effort and evaluation, as well as in the reports of a themes across memories.

By either conceptualization, people high in well-being enjoy positive social reputations (e.g., cheerful, sociable, satisfied with life), are rated as well-adjusted by clinicians (e.g., consistent, resilient), and can be observed to exhibit adaptive social behaviors (e.g., social skill, expressiveness). © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The present two experiments focus on intention initiation. Experiment 1 used a modified event-based paradigm of prospective memory, pre-cuing prospective actions with words varying in association to the target word. State-oriented participants had longer latencies in initiating uncued compared to precued actions under low-positive affect (high listlessness). In Experiment 2, we used a key-pressing task under high vs. low cognitive load (uncompleted vs. completed intention). State-oriented participants under high load had longer latencies when they chose by themselves which of two goals to pursue, compared to an External-Cue condition. Action-oriented participants showed efficient performance in each experiment. The intention-initiation deficit of state-oriented participants was related to higher levels of listlessness (first experiment) or to high load (second experiment) suggesting that motivational factors interact with volitional impairments.

The current study tested the hypothesis that children with high levels of defensive, but not secure, SE would engage in higher levels of aggressive behavior. Ninety-three children completed measures of both explicit and implicit SE. Teachers assessed children's level of physical and relational aggression in the school setting.

Additional analyses revealed, however, that these effects were instead a consequence of the high BPD participants having more unusual, harder-to-predict personalities and more difficult-to-infer thoughts and feelings than those of their low BPD counterparts.

Collectivism was measured with respect to parents, friends, and general others. Results indicate that Chinese participants are less unique but more independent and competitive than their counterparts in the U.S. The expected cultural difference is found for parent collectivism across all three components and for sharing negative outcome with respect to all three reference groups.

Scores on the Attributional Complexity Scale (ACS) have been found to be related to a lesser propensity to error and greater accuracy in social judgment. However, little is known concerning how people who score higher on this scale (the attributionally complex) actually behave or are viewed by others. Participants (n = 178) completed the ACS, their behavior as videotaped during a social interaction was rated by four observers, and they were described by two acquaintances along numerous personality characteristics. Behavior of individuals higher in AC was directly observed to be relatively open, positive, expressive, and socially skilled. Although AC was unrelated to academic achievement or SAT scores, those higher in AC tended to be described by peers as having social wisdom, thoughtfulness, empathy, and openness.

Drawing on a lexical approach to personality, the most commonly-used adjectives within narratives written by college students were identified using computerized text analytic tools. A factor analysis on the use of these adjectives in the self-descriptions produced a 7-factor solution consisting of psychologically meaningful dimensions. Some dimensions were unipolar (e.g., Negativity factor, wherein most loaded items were negatively valenced adjectives); others were dimensional in that semantically opposite words clustered together (e.g., Sociability factor, wherein terms such as shy, outgoing, reserved, and loud all loaded in the same direction). The factors exhibited modest reliability across different types of writing samples and were correlated with self-reports and behaviors consistent with the dimensions. Similar analyses with additional content words (adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) yielded additional psychological dimensions associated with physical appearance, school, relationships, etc. in which people contextualize their self-concepts. The results suggest that the meaning extraction method is a promising strategy that determines the dimensions along which people think about themselves. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Consistent with predictions of the GAM, anger significantly moderated the effect of video game violence on aggression. Specifically, participants who were angry were more affected by violent video games than participants who were not angry. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Studies have suggested that psychopathy is composed of related but distinct factors that manifest divergent relations with a host of constructs including aggression. In the current study, we used a sample of 126 men to examine whether these psychopathy factors are differentially related to aggression manifested in two conditions (instrumental and hostile/reactive aggression) of a laboratory aggression paradigm. Traits related to an antagonistic interpersonal style and emotional detachment (i.e., Factor 1) were related to aggression in both conditions whereas traits related to negative emotionality, impulsivity, and an antagonistic style (i.e., Factor 2) were related to aggression only in the hostile/reactive condition. Potential explanations for these findings are put forth. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

As predicted, a positive linear relation was found, for men and women, between interpersonal dominance and the number of partners a person had for each type of sexual activity. Additionally, for both men and women, a curvilinear relation was found between interpersonal warmth and the number of partners a person had for each type of sexual activity. Specifically, participants who were either extremely warm or extremely cold tended to have more sexual partners than individuals who were moderately warm.

The present study focuses on a widespread occupational stressor: emotional labour (EL). EL refers to the act of managing emotions and emotional expressions in order to be consistent with organizational 'display rules', defined as the organizationally required emotions during interpersonal service transactions. As these display rules interact with employees spontaneous feelings, they regularly induce a clash between inner/real and required feelings. Different strategies exist to cope with this dissonance, with either beneficial or deleterious outcomes regarding psychological and physical health. The hypothesis underlying this study was that individuals varying in the level of trait EI would use different EL strategies, with different outcomes in terms of burnout and somatic complaints. Globally, the results showed that, when confronted with emotional labour, high trait EI individuals experience lower levels of burnout and somatic complaints, and this effect was found to be mediated by the choice of emotional labour strategies. Implications of these results for research, theory and practice are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Correlations between a general trait disgust measure and these outcomes were more modest. A structural equation model indicated that colostomy patients who had high disgust sensitivity felt more stigmatized, and this was in turn strongly related to lower life satisfaction.

Journal of Research in Personality] has recently described a novel method for computing hierarchical component structures via a "top down" design. He calls his method the "Bass Ackwards" approach to distinguish it from more common "bottom up" methods for obtaining hierarchical solutions. Using simple matrix equations, in this commentary I demonstrate that the end result of a Bass Ackwards analysis-that is, the correlations between component scores from different levels of a hierarchy-can be calculated without calculating the actual component scores. By avoiding component-score calculation, Goldberg's method (a) can be applied to any data set in which a correlation matrix is available, and (b) can be applied to factor scores rather than estimated factor scores. Goldberg suggests that the Bass Ackwards method represents a useful tool for elucidating the underlying dimensionality and latent structure (rotation in hyperspace) of a data set. Computer code is reported in the Appendix A of this article to help personality researchers more fully evaluate this claim in empirical and simulated data. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In a recent paper in this journal, Funder [Funder, D. C. (2006). Towards a resolution of the personality triad: persons, situations and behaviors. Journal of Research in Personality, 40, 21-34] stated that the effects of person and situation on behavior were independent in principle. In this comment, we argue that Funder's claim is not a basic law of psychology, but a product of the common statistical approach to define person effects by Pearson correlations and situation effects by differences in group means. As an alternative, we suggest using Intraclass correlations (ICC) with an absolute agreement definition as indicators of intraindividual stability. This approach enables us to directly determine, how much people's behavior varies or remains the same across situations. We demonstrate the usefulness of the ICC approach, by applying it to both hypothetical and empirical data. However, the question which model is more appropriate is a conceptual one and cannot be answered empirically. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A display informed respondents of the intensity of delivered feedback. Instructions were to provide feedback as often as required and of intensities deemed appropriate. However, respondents were also told to refrain from using extremely high intensities, as these intensities would be hurtful to the learner. None of the three independent variables exerted appreciable influence on the frequency of use of recommended feedback. In contrast, the frequency of the use of the disallowed, hurtful feedback was markedly affected. Independent of exposure to film content, men scoring high on hostility used impulsive aggressive responses more frequently than men scoring low on that subtrait. Within the subtrait of physical aggression, however, the degree of trait manifestation proved inconsequential for impulsive aggression, but exposure to the violent film segment resulted in more frequent use of impulsive aggressive responses than exposure to the innocuous film segment. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Self-reported shyness was not related to the number of prompted self-disclosures in the no webcam condition, suggesting that shyness was context dependent.

Study 2 is a preliminary examination of how pathological rater traits impacts thin slice accuracy. In Study 2, peer and self-report data were examined regarding 87 thin slice raters. Raters who exhibited traits of narcissistic personality disorder were significantly less accurate in making personality predictions regarding targets. Three clusters of personality items were identified based on rater characteristics related to accuracy in predicting behavior. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In Study 1, participants took part in simulated employment interviews and then both the participants and lay interviewers completed an overt integrity test comparable to the Reid Report integrity survey [Reid London House. (2004). Abbreviated Reid Report. Minneapolis, MN: NCS Pearson]. Self-lay judge agreement and peer-lay judge agreement were used as the criteria for accuracy. In Study 2, participants took part in either a simulated structured, unstructured or informal employment interview format and completed both overt and covert integrity inventories. The results suggest that lay judges (as well as acquaintances) are fairly accurate in assessing others' integrity levels based upon a very brief 10-min interaction with an individual, when using either an overt or covert integrity inventory. The findings also suggest that the informal interview format can significantly enhance the accuracy of a lay-judge's assessment of the participant's integrity level when a covert measure of integrity is used. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Generally speaking, domain-specific self-evaluations showed rank-order consistency and very small normative changes during this interval. Nonetheless, there were individual differences in change in self-evaluations that warrant additional theoretical and empirical attention. In terms of the prediction of global self-esteem, physical self-esteem was one of the strongest independent predictors of global self-esteem. Finally, weighting domain specific self-evaluations by importance ratings did not consistently improve the prediction of global self-esteem. The implications of these results for understanding the psychological nature of young adulthood and for designing future studies using importance ratings are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A group of 95 student volunteers were administered the PPI and a variety of neuropsychological measures. Analyses revealed that total PPI scores were related to deficits in response inhibition but not general ECF. However, this relationship was qualified by the differential associations observed for the two PPI factors. The social deviance factor was associated with deficits in general ECF and response inhibition, whereas the affective-interpersonal facet was associated with enhanced general ECF performance but not response inhibition. The results suggest that cognitive functioning shows predicted associations with a self-report measure of psychopathy among non-incarcerated young adults, providing further evidence for psychopathy conceptualizations from a normal-range personality perspective. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The cost incurred by engaging in unconditional altruism is lower for highly intelligent people than for less intelligent people because they may expect to regain the drained resources. As a result, unconditional altruism can serve as an honest signal of intelligence. Our findings imply that distinguishing altruistic behavior from cooperative behavior in social psychological and economic theories of human behavior might be useful and that costly signaling theory may provide novel insights on various individual difference variables. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In this longitudinal study, narratives of life "turning points" and significant accomplishments were examined for generative themes in 32 adolescent/emerging adults (aged 16 and 20 years). We also explored these emerging adults' volunteering behavior, prosocial reasoning, and parental influence as potential factors in generativity. Several parenting factors when adolescents were 16 (parents' autonomy-encouraging practices, their emphasis on caring in stories of family value teaching, and adolescents' reports of authoritative parenting style) were associated with more generative themes in narratives at age 20. Adolescents' levels of prosocial reasoning, volunteering behavior, and personal value choices were also associated as expected with generative theme usage at age 20 in life stories, supporting the meaningfulness of this construct in emerging adulthood. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {In several areas of personality research (e.g., personal networks, interpersonal behaviour, academic effort), the empirical data represent a multilevel structure, in which within-person variables are nested within individuals. Both within-person variation and between-person differences can be related to outcome variables (e.g., emotions, life satisfaction). One major precondition for aggregating within-person data to the between-person level is sufficient reliability of the aggregated data, a point that has received scant attention in previous research. Drawing on the example of personal goal research, we recommend that the two major forms of the intraclass correlation coefficient-the ICC(1) and the ICC(2)-be applied to within-person data in idiographic research designs. These indices allow the homogeneity and reliability of within-person data to be determined separately. Their application is illustrated using data from a study with 4,565 young adults. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The measures differ in relational specificity, however, as attachment anxiety and avoidance assess models of close and romantic relationships, whereas sociotropy and autonomy reflect more abstracted representations that encompass broader categories of social relation. The proposed framework offers a variety of avenues for research operationalizing and elaborating upon the function of global relational models in the attachment system. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

For T to be considered a biological marker of dispositional dominance it is critical that it demonstrates high test-retest reliability and good convergent and discriminant validity. Two studies tested the temporal stability of salivary T in humans and the relationship between T and traditional measures of personality. Across both studies, test-retest reliability for T was high and comparable to the short-term stability of questionnaire-based and implicitly assessed personality assessment instruments. In being modestly correlated with self-reported dominance, T showed some evidence of convergent validity. In being statistically independent from conceptually unrelated personality constructs (such as Emotional Stability and Openness to Experience) it showed good evidence of discriminant validity. The findings strengthen the psychometric foundation for using T as a hormonal marker of individual differences. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Participants (n = 172), in groups of four mutual acquaintances, provided ratings of one another's standing, and estimates of their own standing and reputation, on four trait dimensions (moral responsibility, consideration for others, respect for authority, and political orientation). Post-conventional moral reasoning, assessed using the Defining Issues Test, was not significantly related either to reputation or to self-rating on any dimension except political orientation. Conventional reasoning was related to politics though in the opposite direction, but additionally to both self- and other-ratings of moral responsibility and to the corresponding ratings of respect for authority. Findings do not support the view that the conventional/post-conventional distinction in moral reasoning is a developmental difference. An alternative proposed is that these are independent domains of moral thought, related to quite different aspects of social behaviour and political attitudes. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In these studies, participants imagined themselves in several interpersonal situations presented in a paper-and-pencil protocol and responded to questions about what they expected would happen after they behaved defensively or nondefensively. As predicted, results indicated that, according to participants' implicit lay beliefs, defensive behavior as compared to nondefensive behavior makes short-term clear-cut feared occurrences less likely, reduces the likelihood of clear-cut wished-for short-term outcomes, and affects how these outcomes will be experienced when they do take place. Also, findings indicated that there was an inverse association between self-reports of behaving defensively and the extent to which participants appreciated the short-term costs of defensive behavior. Alternative models for explaining this association are considered, including the idea that expectations minimizing the costs of defensive behavior develop because they support previously established, emotionally charged interpersonal behavior patterns. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

First, it is not clear whether healthy creatives have a milder loading on schizotypal traits than people who suffer serious psychopathology, or whether they have an equal loading, but other mediating characteristics. Second, most of the existing research has concentrated on artistic creativity, and the position of other creative domains is not yet clear. The present study compares schizotypy profiles using the O-LIFE inventory in a large sample of poets, artists, mathematicians, the general population, and psychiatric patients. Poets and artists have levels of unusual experiences that are higher than controls, and as high as schizophrenia patients. However, they are relatively low on the dimension of introvertive anhedonia. Mathematicians are lower than controls on unusual experiences. The results suggest that artistic creatives and psychiatric patients share a tendency to unusual ideas and experiences, but creative groups are distinguished by the absence of anhedonia and avolition. Moreover, different domains of creativity require different cognitive profiles, with poetry and art associated with divergent thinking, schizophrenia and affective disorder, and mathematics associated with convergent thinking and autism. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Results indicated significant individual differences in rates of change for both positive and negative affect.

Higher extraversion was associated with higher levels of positive affect, but not with rate of change. Higher neuroticism predicted higher levels of negative affect, as well as an attenuated decline in middle-adulthood, and a steeper increase in later adulthood. Better health was associated with higher levels of positive affect and lower levels of negative, but was also found to predict less decline in negative affect. Work predicted lower levels of positive affect and higher levels of negative affect, as well as greater declines in positive affect.

In six studies (N = 1080) we found that more acceptance of stereotyping was associated with more explicit and implicit stereotyping of particular groups, less liberal gender-role values, more authoritarian attitudes, preference for hierarchies, higher social dominance orientation, less universal outlook, less complexity in describing others' emotions, less utilization of emotional information, and more utilization of social categories (gender and race) when rating the similarity of faces, less agreeable and more agentic personality, and more rigid and simplistic cognitive style (all independent of one's gender). Female and African-American participants were less accepting of stereotyping than male and Caucasian participants.

Positive humor styles and trait cheerfulness were positively correlated with various domains of social competence, whereas negative humor styles and trait bad mood were negatively correlated with social competence. Finally, the emotional management facet of EI was positively correlated with several social competence domains. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The present investigation sought to extend such individual differences to the cognitive level of analysis. It was hypothesized that individual differences in agreeableness would predict the extent to which either antisocial or prosocial words are selected for prolonged processing. Two studies, involving 90 undergraduates, asked participants to encode prosocial and antisocial stimuli, before measuring the speed with which they could spatially disengage attention from such stimuli. As predicted, individuals low in agreeableness exhibited difficulties disengaging from antisocial stimuli, whereas individuals high in agreeableness exhibited difficulties disengaging from prosocial stimuli. This novel finding isolates a particular set of attentional processes that likely contribute to agreeableness-related outcomes such as anger and aggression. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Because approach and avoidance stem from independent motivational systems, we hypothesized and found that following positive feelings and following negative feelings are separable dimensions. In part 1, we developed a measure, called the Following Affective States Test (FAST), to assess these dimensions and provided psychometric data supporting its adequacy. In part 2, we continued to validate the scale and found that this new conceptualization clarifies the debate concerning whether following feelings is psychologically beneficial.

  abstract = {In everyday life, individuals actively regulate their emotions in a variety of ways. One common form of emotion regulation is expressive suppression, which entails inhibiting outward signs of emotion. Although expressive suppression is often undertaken with an eye to looking calm despite feeling emotional, an analysis of its self-regulatory demands suggests that this form of emotion regulation may come at a cognitive price. We tested this hypothesis in two studies. In Study 1, we measured spontaneously occurring expressive suppression during a film that depicted a surgical procedure, and then assessed memory for the film. Greater use of suppression predicted worse memory. In Study 2, we examined expressive suppression during a film that depicted a conflictual conversation, and we measured memory for what was said during the conversation. To gauge the magnitude of any cognitive costs, we compared expressive suppression with self-distraction, which entails intentionally trying not to think about something. Both spontaneously occurring and experimentally induced suppression were associated with worse memory. Strikingly, these effects were comparable to the effects of spontaneously occurring and experimentally induced distraction. These studies suggest that "simply" keeping a stiff upper lip during an emotional event exacts a cognitive toll that is as great as intentional cognitive avoidance. We argue that efforts to understand links between emotion and memory must consider emotion regulation. © 2005.},

This pattern seems to be based, at least in part, on widely held preconceptions about the costs of non-self-report methods, such as informant methods. Researchers seem to believe that informant methods are: (a) time-consuming, (b) expensive, (c) ineffective (i.e., informants will not cooperate), and (d) particularly vulnerable to faking or invalid responses. This article evaluates the validity of these preconceptions in light of recent advances in Internet technology, and proposes some strategies for making informant methods more effective. Drawing on data from three separate studies, I demonstrate that, using these strategies, informant reports can be collected with minimal effort and few monetary costs. In addition, informants are generally very willing to cooperate (e.g., response rates of 76-95%) and provide valid data (in terms of strong consensus and self-other agreement). Informant reports represent a mostly untapped resource that researchers can use to improve the validity of personality assessments and to address new questions that cannot be examined with self-reports alone. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In Experiment 1, state extraversion was manipulated by instructing participants to act extraverted and introverted during two different discussions with two other participants. Participants reported more positive affect when instructed to act extraverted than when instructed to act introverted, and this finding was supported by the ratings of observers. In Experiment 2, state neuroticism was manipulated by instructing participants to act neurotic and emotionally stable during two different discussions. Participants reported more negative affect when instructed to act neurotic than when instructed to act stable. Thus, at least some part of the extraversion-positive affect and neuroticism-negative affect relationships may be accounted for by the causal influences of extraverted behavior and neurotic behavior, respectively. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We measured need for power using (Winter's, 1973) Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) measure. Half the participants viewed a videotape of an interview in which an actor portrayed himself as highly assertive. The other half saw the actor portray himself as moderately but not excessively compliant. Participants high in power motivation exhibited high electromyographic responsivity from the brow supercilli (frown muscles) when exposed to the assertive candidate, higher than participants low in power motivation and higher than all participants who viewed the compliant candidate (p < .05). Scores on the Affective Attitudes Scale (Crites, Fabrigar, & Petty, 1994) assumed the same pattern (p < .01).

After controlling for personality, however, the positive association between deviance markers and overall misconduct was eliminated. This finding undermines the allegation that acquiring deviance markers directly increases the likelihood of misconduct. One exception was a significant positive association between deviance markers and drug abuse that remained after controlling for personality.

The most widespread measure used by non-clinical researchers, the 40-item Narcissistic Personality Inventory or NPI-40, captures a range of different facets of the construct but its length may prohibit its use in settings where time pressure and respondent fatigue are major concerns. In this article, we draw from the NPI-40 set of items to create and validate a shorter, unidimensional measure, the NPI-16. In five studies, we show that this short NPI closely parallels the NPI-40 in its relation to other personality measures and dependent variables. We conclude that the NPI-16 has notable face, internal, discriminant, and predictive validity and that it can serve as an alternative measure of narcissism when situations do not allow the use of longer inventories. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Participants completed two implicit sexual interest tasks in addition to questionnaires of self-deception and homophobia. We found that self-deception moderated the relationship between homophobia and performance within the implicit tasks. Contrary to the idea that defensive homophobics (i.e., homophobics high in self-deception) harbor an implicit attraction for gay sex, we found that such individuals displayed evidence of a phobic-like aversion. We also identified a non-defensive form of homophobia (i.e., homophobics low in self-deception) that was relatively inconsequential for performance within the implicit cognitive tasks related to gay sex. The results suggest that defensive homophobics have an implicit aversion rather than an implicit attraction to gay sexual stimuli. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In all conditions, people with higher scores on histrionic and narcissistic personality traits were rated in a more positive manner, and those with higher scores on schizoid and avoidant personality traits were rated more negatively.

A computer-administered visual analog procedure is presented that samples 40 equally spaced positions along a trait continuum five times. Examinees initiate each trial by pressing the space bar and end it by pressing either a "True" or "False" key indicating if that location describes them or not. Response time is measured in milliseconds. The majority answer determines the aggregate response and the median response time determines the latency for the aggregate response to each location on the trait continuum. This procedure enables an empirical measure of trait variability. Results indicated theoretically meaningful responses in 94 college students on each of two personality dimensions; extraversion and trait anxiety. The predicted inverted-U function was obtained for both personality dimensions such that the fastest response times were associated with 0 and 5 "True" responses, somewhat longer response times were associated with 1 and 4 "True" responses, and the longest times were associated with 2 or 3 "True" responses.

The results indicated that among the "Big 3" personality dimensions, impulsivity/disinhibition is most strongly related to ASB and extraversion/sociability is least strongly related to ASB.

The judges were then given a head and shoulders photograph of the target person and asked to rate him or her on several physical characteristics. The results indicated a substantial effect of the honesty manipulation on judges' perceptions, whereby the honest target, as opposed to the dishonest target, was seen as being more fit and in better health and as having a face that looked more kind, feminine, and attractive. Analysis of covariance showed that these effects were largely mediated by a general liking for the target. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Perceived regard from others predicted concurrent trait self-esteem and longitudinal change in self-esteem, irrespective of social approval contingency. Approval contingency did not predict longitudinal change in self-esteem, although self-esteem predicted longitudinal change in approval contingency. These results, which support the sociometer model, were consistent across two somewhat different measures of social approval contingency and four indices of perceived regard and social inclusion. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Higher social anxiety uniquely predicted greater interpersonally generated NA in Study 1, and in Study 2, this relationship varied by social context. Specifically, high compared to low socially anxious individuals reported greater NA during small-talk, with no differences during intimate interactions. Furthermore, Study 2 demonstrated that individuals with stronger BAS's experienced greater PA in the intimate compared to small-talk condition.

Harrison Gough reported that when he wrote items for the California Psychological Inventory (CPI; Gough & Bradley, 1996), he tried to make the items as ego-syntonic as possible. Ego-syntonic items are those "which a respondent finds congenial, and on which giving an opinion is a rewarding act" (Gough & Bradley, 1996, p. 10). The present study asked 79 respondents to report how they felt after answering each CPI item. Average affect ratings were above neutral for a majority of items, indicating that Gough had some success in writing ego-syntonic items. Differences in item ego-syntonicity were attributable to other item characteristics. Respondents disliked responding to relatively odd and ambiguous items, items with linguistic negations, and items referring to negative feelings and situations. As predicted by Gough, respondents enjoyed responding to items on the communality scale, items with which most people agree. They also enjoyed items that referred to positive emotions and attitudes and to items indicating extraversion, conscientiousness, low neuroticism, and openness to experience. Highly ego-syntonic items were found to be more valid than less ego-syntonic items. Individuals who reported disliking many items were found to be socially anxious. The relation between reports of liking or disliking items, identity, and reputation are discussed, and further research on item response dynamics and validity is proposed. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Currently over 80 publications using IPIP scales are listed at the IPIP Web site (http://ipip.ori.org), and the rate of IPIP-related publications has been increasing rapidly. The growing popularity of the IPIP can be attributed to five factors: (1) It is cost free; (2) its items can be obtained instantaneously via the Internet; (3) it includes over 2000 items, all easily available for inspection; (4) scoring keys for IPIP scales are provided; and (5) its items can be presented in any order, interspersed with other items, reworded, translated into other languages, and administered on the World Wide Web without asking permission of anyone. The unrestricted availability of the IPIP raises concerns about possible misuse by unqualified persons, and the freedom of researchers to use the IPIP in idiosyncratic ways raises the possibility of fragmentation rather than scientific unification in personality research. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

I then review evidence to show that valence is a variant property of emotional responding, in that people differ from one another in the degree to which they focus on valence.

Further discussion considers the personal source of behavioral invariance, the situational source of behavioral variation, the person-situation interaction, the nature of behavior, and the "personality triad" of persons, situations, and behaviors, in which each element is understood and predicted in terms of the other two. An important goal for future research is further development of theories and methods for conceptualizing and measuring the functional aspects of situations and of behaviors. One reason for the persistence of the person situation debate may be that it serves as a proxy for a deeper, implicit debate over values such as equality vs. individuality, determinism vs. free will, and flexibility vs. consistency. However, these value dichotomies may be as false as the person-situation debate that they implicitly drive. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This article investigates the generalization of brief under control (UC) and ER self-report scales across samples, measurement techniques, and data sources, utilizing personality descriptions provided by acquaintances, clinician-interviewers, and the self. Undercontrolled individuals were consistently described as self-dramatizing, unable to delay gratification, unpredictable, assertive, rebellious, moody, and self-indulgent. Overcontrolled individuals were consistently described as bland, consistent, dependable, and calm. Resilient individuals were described as having wide interests and a high aspiration level, assertive, socially poised and skilled, and cheerful; and not self-defeating, emotionally bland, nor lacking personal meaning in life. The definitive characteristics of both constructs were mostly consistent across data source, gender, and ethnicity, although ego-resiliency conformed more reliably with theoretical expectations among females than males, while ego-undercontrol may have more negative implications among Caucasians than other ethnic groups. Overall, the UC and ER self-report scales appear to offer effective, efficient, and accessible means for investigating these constructs. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

By contrast, Neuroticism was associated with measures of anxiety and Extraversion was associated with difficulty inhibiting behaviors at both ages. Openness to Experience was associated with sophisticated play behavior at 5 years and self-confidence in adolescence. Overall, this study yielded strong support for the predictive validity of the FFM with preschool age children and provided further evidence that there are striking continuities in personality from early childhood to adolescence. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Measures included Allport and Ross' (1967) Intrinsic and Extrinsic Religiosity scales, Templer's (1970) Death Anxiety scale, Osarchuk and Tatz' (1973) belief in the afterlife scale, and the satisfaction with life scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1986).

Consistent with socioemotional selectivity theory, older adults had more optimistic explanatory styles than their younger counterparts in the positive affiliation domain, and this effect remained significant after controlling for a number of demographic and affective covariates. In contrast, older individuals reported less optimistic explanatory styles for negative health/cognitive events. No age differences in dispositional optimism or pessimism remained after controlling for covariates. Main effects of negative affiliation explanatory style and dispositional optimism and pessimism were found in the prediction of well-being measures across age groups. However, no significant Age × Optimism interactions emerged in the prediction of depression or life satisfaction, providing no support for the assertion that optimism may relate to well-being differently at different times in the adult life span. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In Experiment 1 this pattern could be shown only for success-oriented individuals. The reverse was true for failure-threatened participants. In Experiment 2, the Motive × Action Phase interaction was replicated with a different measure of probability of success.

At the same time, researchers in both developmental and personality-social psychology have made great progress in testing and elaborating ideas presented by John Bowlby in his famous trilogy on attachment and loss. What outsiders to that perspective may not realize is that Bowlby was a psychoanalyst who saw himself as retracing Freud's steps but with the advantage of new theoretical and empirical strategies. In this article, we conceptualize attachment theory as a contemporary psychodynamic approach, show how this theory has helped to bring psychodynamic psychology back to life, and review empirical evidence from our laboratories that supports many of the psychodynamic hypotheses advanced by Bowlby. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Estimates of protocol invalidity were derived from a sample of 23,994 protocols produced by individuals who completed an on-line version of the 300-item IPIP representation of the NEO-PI-R (Goldberg, 1999). Approximately 3.8% of the protocols were judged to be products of repeat participants, many of whom apparently resubmitted after changing some of their answers. Among non-duplicate protocols, about 3.5% came from individuals who apparently selected a response option repeatedly without reading the item, compared to .9% in a sample of paper-and-pencil protocols. The missing response rate was 1.2%, which is 2-10 times higher than the rate found in several samples of paper-and-pencil inventories of comparable length. Two measures of response consistency indicated that perhaps 1% of the protocols were invalid due to linguistic incompetence or inattentive responding, but that Web participants were as consistent as individuals responding to a paper-and-pencil inventory. Inconsistency did not affect factorial structure and was found to be related positively to neuroticism and negatively to openness to experience. Intentional misrepresentation was not studied directly, but arguments for a low incidence of misrepresentation are presented. Methods for preventing, detecting, and handling invalid response patterns are discussed. Suggested for future research are studies that assess the moderating effects of linguistic incompetence, inattentiveness, and intentional misrepresentation on agreement between self-report and acquaintance judgments about personality. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this essay I outline a theory, Dynamic Integration Theory, which proposes that these two aspects can be integrated by expanding on Piaget's concept of representation as a relationship between self and object to one between a self and an other. Thus as in development, representations increase in cognitive complexity, the affective dynamics of self in relation to the social world are dynamically reorganized as new cognitive and affective systems differentiate and eventually evolve higher-order integrations. However, since the capacity for integration depends on a context of well-regulated emotional activation, Dynamic Integration Theory also defines typical deviations from the ideal of integration in the form of over- or under-differentiation. The resulting variations in integration have significance for describing optimal developmental pathways as well as deviations from those pathways. These aspects are exemplified by analyses from an ongoing project on cognitive-affective development from adolescence to late life. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Measures of dispositional forgiveness, narcissism, global self-esteem, and vengeance were administered to 248 undergraduates. As expected, people low in dispositional forgiveness were more vengeful than were people high in dispositional forgiveness, but particularly so among those high in narcissism; among those low in narcissism, forgiveness was less strongly related to vengeance.

Behavioral consistency was examined in terms of single behaviors and person-centered behavioral profiles. Addressing subjective situational similarity, Study 1 showed that participants who rated the two situations as relatively similar were relatively consistent in their behavior across the situations. Addressing objective situational similarity, defined as the degree to which situations shared common elements, Study 2 showed that participants were more behaviorally consistent across similar pairs of situations than across dissimilar pairs. In addition, Study 2 found that behaviors that are relatively automatic and impulsive were more consistent than behaviors that are more controlled and cognitively mediated.

It is particularly well-suited to capture multidimensional individual differences-implying complex person by situation and/or person by response interactions-and to examine the psychological mechanisms underlying them. In an application to anger-in and anger-out in interpersonal frustrating situations, three person types were derived that were characterized in terms of distinctive behavioral signatures.

These data demonstrate that highly correlated measures of the same target constructs show significantly different levels of stability, even over 2-month retest intervals during which true change should be minimal.

To this end, we constructed a risk-taking questionnaire, assessing violations of military conduct, and tapping various target risk-taking activities (i.e., weapon-related risk taking). In attempting to draw a personality profile of a weapon-related risk taker, we assumed that the offender would probably score high on both psychoticism (P) and neuroticism (N), though not necessarily high on extraversion (E), and thus would conform to some current ideas on the relationship between personality and criminality. We also viewed the offender using a sensation-seeking lens, assuming that the offender, serving in a combat unit, would score high on thrill and adventure seeking, but more importantly, would also score high on both disinhibition and boredom susceptibility, both of which would predispose him to an impulsive, unsocialized form of sensation seeking. In the data analysis, we tried to mesh both patterns of risk taking and antisocial predispositions in order to achieve some degree of coherence. Our results indicate that target offenders seem to score high on P and low on the Eysenckian Lie Scale (L). © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We hypothesized that improved academic outcomes were likely only when a possible self could plausibly be a self-regulator. Hierarchical regression analyses supported this conclusion, with more support for the influence of self-regulation on change in behavior and academic outcomes than on affect regulation. N = 160 low-income eighth graders improved grades, spent more time doing homework, participated in class more, and were referred less to summer school (controlling for fall grades and the dependent variable of interest) when academic possible selves were plausibly self-regulatory. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

We then highlight recent findings that attest to the value of a social-cognitive model of culture. Specifically, we discuss studies that have demonstrated how well established cross-cultural differences may appear or disappear depending on the availability, accessibility, and applicability of cultural theories. We present evidence that situational characteristics may render cultural theories more or less accessible and applicable, and propose a culture × situation interaction model for understanding inter- and intracultural variations. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. all rights reserved.},

By adapting, for the first time, the dot-probe attentional task for use in the scanner, we discovered that activation in the fusiform, gyrus is significantly correlated with E. The greatest activation was observed in conditions in which an attentional probe was placed in a section of the visual field least likely to be attended to by highly extroverted individuals. This activation may reflect increased effort related to visual search, autonomic arousal, or detection of an unexpected occurrence. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, it is also related to higher scores on measures of creativity and increased right-hemisphere brain activity, In a series of recent studies investigating the behavioral, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging correlates of positive and negative schizotypy, positive schizotypy was associated with better performance on measures of creativity, enhanced responsivity to threatening emotional stimuli, and more right-prefrontal cortical activity. These results support earlier psychological studies suggesting that positive schizotypy is related to patterns of cognitive and emotional function (e.g., divergent thinking, heightened emotion) that are common to both creativity and psychopathology. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

A forced comparison was created in which 79 college students completed a word finding task and received feedback about their performance along with that of a better or worse performing confederate. Autonomy orientation moderated comparison consequences such that less autonomous individuals experienced increased negative changes in affect and decreased self-esteem when paired with a better performing other.

The participants (n = 629) were about equally drawn from each of the age years 12-17. Structural equation modeling analyses were conducted to examine the construct validity of scores on the three research instruments. Moreover, structural equations modeling showed that self-attribution of ability is, to some extent, dependent on cognitive performance. Cognitive performance is weakly related only to two of the Big Five (openness and conscientiousness). Self-attribution of ability is substantially related to all but the neuroticism factor. Apart from openness to experience, the dependence of personality dimensions on the dimensions of cognitive self-representation tends to weaken with age. It is concluded that the influence of cognitive abilities on personality is mediated by self-awareness about them and implications are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

The ability to recognize emotions, intentions, and thoughts of others is an important component of social competence. The use of personality questionnaires implies that people are aware of their personality traits, experienced emotions, values, and attitudes. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that a normal adult is aware of his or her mind-reading abilities and can estimate, in relation to the others, how good he or she is at judging other person's traits, states of mind, emotions, and intentions. In this study we have demonstrated that a person's beliefs about their own mind-reading ability forms a single and unitary dimension. If a person believes that he or she is competent in forming judgments about another person's personality traits then he or she has a relatively high opinion of their abilities to read another person's thoughts and emotions. However, the results of our research show that the self-reported mind-reading ability was not correlated with actual performance. Those who believe that they are good at reading others' minds are generally neither (1) significantly better than the others in recognition of emotions expressed in face or speech, nor (2) superior in their estimation of the personality traits of a stranger. The self-reported mind-reading ability was correlated with personality traits but not with psychometrically measured intelligence. On the contrary, the actual mind-reading performance was correlated with IQ scores. It is discussed why individuals are relatively accurate in estimation of their own personality but lack metaknowledge about their mind-reading abilities. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

We expected and found that measures tapping sensitivity to rewards or positive outcomes would load on a common appetitive latent factor, whereas, measures tapping individual differences in sensitivity to punishment or negative outcomes would load a common aversive latent factor. Results strongly supported the hypothesized two-factor structure over alternative models and indicated that the latent appetitive and aversive variables accounted for about half the variance in the observed variables. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

  abstract = {This study investigates relations between personality traits and everyday behavior - an area of research that too often is ignored in contemporary personality assessment. Participants completed personality questionnaires and for 2 weeks kept daily records of behaviors related conceptually to 1 of 3 traits: aggression, exhibitionism, and impulsivity. Aggregating across time, correlations between 2 measures of trait aggression correlated .51 with behavioral aggression but only .14 and .18 with behavioral exhibitionism and behavioral impulsivity, respectively. Trait exhibitionism and trait impulsivity demonstrated similarly clean convergent/ discriminant correlational patterns with the three types of behaviors. Many individual behavioral items also showed significant correlations with corresponding personality traits. Results are discussed in terms of using personality-behavior relations to further understanding of personality. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Objective: To validate a measure of psychological motivations to eat based on a four-category model of motivations for alcohol use (Cooper, 1994). Motivations specified by this model are: to cope with negative affect, to be social, to comply with others' expectations, and to enhance pleasure. Method: In Study 1, 40 respondents were queried in an open-ended format about their reasons for eating; responses were content-coded to determine if they fit into the four theorized categories. In Study 2, an item pool was generated based on responses from Study 1, and random halves of a sample of 812 college students were used to test and then validate the hypothesized factor structure. Results: As expected, the final inventory yielded the four theorized categories. The factor structure was generally invariant across gender, and the resulting Motivations to Eat subscales uniquely predicted restrictive eating, bingeing, and purging. Discussion: Prior eating research has focused mainly on coping and compliance motivations. The present study identified four distinct motivations to eat that potentially are important for understanding healthy and disordered eating. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

  volume = {4},
  issn = {00926566},
  abstract = {This paper deals with psychological differences between two cultures, with respect to the differences between individuals in those same cultures. Five principles are presented which describe either actual or probable empirical relationships between within- and between-culture differences, and a possible theoretical account is given for each of the presumed differences. (1) The differences between "cultures" seem "bigger" than the actual differences between the individuals in these same cultures. This relation is attributed to the idea that universal human biological predispositions are often opposed by cultural traditions, so the outcome is somewhat of a compromise between the two. (2) Differences between individuals in different cultures are generally larger in behavior than in thoughts or feelings This is attributed to the fact that it is easier to socialize behavior than mental events. (3) Many cultural differences are expressed in individuals in terms of different default responses or interpretations or preferences for the same situation. Dominant responses in one culture are usually a less salient part of the repertoire of individuals in another culture. (4) Much of the effect of culture, and our impression of culture differences, results from the physical/social artifacts (environments, institutions) created by the culture. There is a strong tendency by psychologists to under-rate or ignore the effects of the physical environment. (5) In the contemporary world, differences between individuals in two cultures will be larger in older generations. Cultural differences may be markedly reduced in the most recent generations, on account of globalization. The position put forth is an attempt to integrate the ideas that there are real human predispositions of various sorts and that culture is a powerful force, and to explain why it is surprisingly easy for us to understand the viewpoint of people from other cultures (their "reality" is often a less preferred alternative in our own repertoire). © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

  abstract = {The biographies of 280 scientists indicate that the distribution of their age at the time of their greatest scientific contributions in their careers (age-genius curve) is similar to the age distribution of criminals (age-crime curve). The age-genius curves among jazz musicians, painters and authors are also similar to the age-crime curve. Further, marriage has a strong desistance effect on both crime and genius. I argue that this is because both crime and genius stem from men's evolved psychological mechanism which compels them to be highly competitive in early adulthood but "turns off" when they get married and have children. Fluctuating levels of testosterone, which decreases when men get married and have children, can provide the biochemical microfoundation for this psychological mechanism. If crime and genius have the same underlying cause, then it is unlikely that social control theory (or any other theory specific to criminal behavior) can explain why men commit crimes and why they desist. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

This typology, however, does not differentiate between the two factors comprising social desirability (impression management and self-deception). In this research, participants completed measures of anxiety and social desirability, attempted to recall childhood emotional experiences, and indicated their mood at the time of recall. A regression procedure was used to uncover the best predictors of recalled negative emotional experiences. Anxiety and self-deception (but not impression management) significantly predicted memory performance. This supports the view of repressors as deceiving themselves rather than engaging in impression management. Mood at the time of recall was related to memory, but only partially explained the impoverished memory of repressors. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {To what extent and which personality traits predict academic performance was investigated in two longitudinal studies of two British university samples. Academic performance was assessed throughout a three years period and via multiple criteria (e.g., exams and final-year project). In addition several indicators of academic behaviour, e.g., absenteeism, essay writing, tutors' exam predictions, were also examined with regard to both academic performance and personality traits. In sample 1 (N = 70), the Big Five personality factors (Costa & McCrae, 1992) - particularly Neuroticism and Conscientiousness - were found to predict overall final exam marks over and above several academic predictors, accounting for more than 10% of unique variance in overall exam marks. Results suggest that Neuroticism may impair academic performance, while Conscientiousness may lead to higher academic achievement. In sample 2 (N = 75) the EPQ-R (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1985 was used as the personality measure and results showed the three superfactors were the most powerful predictor of academic performance, accounting for nearly 17% of unique variance in overall exam results. It is demonstrated that (like Neuroctisim) Psychoticism could limit academic success. The present results provide evidence supporting the inclusion of well-established personality measures in academic selection procedures, and run counter to the traditional view of ability measures as the exclusive psychometric correlate of academic performance. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

As predicted, the asymmetrical faces were rated as significantly more Neurotic, less Agreeable and less Conscientious than the normal versions.

However, the predictive validity of explicit self-esteem measures may have been inflated because SWB was assessed by means of self-reports. The present article addresses this concern. We correlated self-reports and informant reports of subjective well-being with an explicit (Rosenberg's self-esteem scale) and an implicit measure of self-esteem (preferences for initials). Explicit self-esteem was a significant predictor of all SWB measures. Preferences for initials were not significantly correlated with any of the SWB measures. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Factor analysis of the new questionnaire revealed five dimensions: self-help, approach, accommodation, avoidance, and self-punishment. To measure these dimensions, we constructed a 5-subscale, 40-item revised COPE (R-COPE). In subsequent studies, the 5 R-COPE subscales were predicted prospectively from one situational variable (perceived control) and one dispositional construct (autonomy versus control orientation). In additional studies, the 5 subscales served as prospective predictors of several adjustment and well being indices. These studies along with correlations between the five subscales and other variables demonstrated both convergent and discriminant validity of the R-COPE. Theoretical implications of the 5-factor solution and the case for using the R-COPE in future coping research are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

In Study 1, 28 13-year-old boys categorized as high in self-deception using Eysenck's Junior Lie Scale (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975), played more cards and won significantly less money than 143 categorized as low in self-deception.

First, different researchers have used different criteria to assess bias in self-evaluation. Some have relied on normative models, whereas others have relied on social consensus. We identify problems associated with each of these subjective methods and suggest the use of objective or operational criteria. Second, bias in self-evaluation can result from different motivations. In some cases, overly positive self-reports may reflect self-protective or avoidance motivations, whereas in other cases they may reflect self-enhancement or approach motivations. We argue that it is not the level of self-evaluation bias, per se, that determines whether such bias is associated with positive or negative consequences. Instead, consequences are related to the specific motivation underlying this bias.

Intelligence (primary mental abilities, spatial, and number), intellect, potential, and personality (e.g., self-confidence, tolerance, openness, psychological mindedness, and introversion) at age 27 were expected to covary with creativity at age 27 and predict lifetime creativity at age 72. Yet, due to the non-intellective nature of personality, we predicted that personality would explain unique variance in creativity over and above that already explained by intellect and potential. Results supported each of these expectations. For instance, observer-rated potential and intellect at age 27 predicted lifetime creativity at age 72, and yet personality variables (such as tolerance and psychological mindedness) explained up to 20% of the variance over and above potential and intellect. Rank-order consistency coefficients revealed consistency over 44 years in some traits (e.g., psychological mindedness) and inconsistency in other traits (e.g, dominance). If traits function to lower behavioral thresholds in given situations, then the traits of self-confidence, openness, tolerance, and psychological mindedness (among others) may serve as a relatively direct link to creative behavior. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Specifically, one correlational study showed that measures of central tendency, variability, and skew were uniquely associated with self-ratings of ability level, self-certainty, and implicit theories of intelligence, respectively. An experiment explored the finding that incremental theorists (Dweck, 1999) reported more negatively skewed distributions than entity theorists. Only incremental theorists who wrote essays about recent intellectual growth created negatively skewed distributions; entity theorists did not. Evidence supports the hypotheses that self-report distributions are multiply informative and idiographic measures of self-evaluation, that negative skew on intellectual ability distributions can represent perceptions of growth, and that incremental theorists typically take this perspective when evaluating their own intellectual ability. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Women reported significantly more false-positive errors committed by men than false-negative errors. Men reported roughly equal numbers of false-positive and false-negative errors committed by women, suggesting no bias in women's sexual inferences.

  abstract = {Describes the development and initial validation of the Humor Styles Questionnaire, which assesses four dimensions relating to individual differences in uses of humor. These are: relatively benign uses of humor to enhance the self (Self-enhancing) and to enhance one's relationships with others (Affiliative), use of humor to enhance the self at the expense of others (Aggressive), and use of humor to enhance relationships at the expense of self (Self-defeating). Validation data indicate that the four scales differentially relate in predicted ways to peer ratings of humor styles and to measures of mood (cheerfulness, depression, anxiety, hostility), self-esteem, optimism, well-being, intimacy, and social support. They also relate to all five dimensions of the Five Factor Model and to Agency and Communion. The first two scales overlap with previous humor tests, whereas the Aggressive and Self-defeating humor scales largely tap different dimensions. Males scored higher than females on Aggressive and Self-defeating humor. It is expected that the HSQ will be useful for research on humor and psychological well-being by assessing forms of humor that may be deleterious to health as well as those that are beneficial. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

The use of the immature defenses of denial and projection predicted increased Neuroticism, decreased Extraversion, and decreased Agreeableness.

In a sample of 245 students, we measured the three constructs with standard measures and examined a variety of laboratory and self-report correlates. The measures were moderately inter-correlated, but certainly were not equivalent. Their only common Big Five correlate was disagreeableness. Subclinical psychopaths were distinguished by low neuroticism; Machiavellians, and psychopaths were low in conscientiousness; narcissism showed small positive associations with cognitive ability. Narcissists and, to a lesser extent, psychopaths exhibited self-enhancement on two objectively scored indexes.

First, correlations among same-valenced affects are substantially higher, indicating poorer discriminant validity. Second, cross-valence correlations are much weaker, reflecting a virtual absence of bipolarity. We show how both of these effects are due to an inflated acquiescence component in aggregated data. We also demonstrate that (a) these effects are a direct result of the aggregation process itself and (b) controlling for acquiescence counteracts these effects. These results indicate that the validity of aggregated mood ratings is lessened by an augmented acquiescence component. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

At Level I, the trait level, the parallel process construct is that of states. Level II constructs, or personal concerns, have their parallel in self-regulatory processes in service of individual goals. The Level III construct, the life story, has its process counterparts in social cognitive activities related to recounting life narratives, such as remembering, reminiscence, and storytelling. A brief overview of these six foci of personality demonstrates that each are firmly anchored in the aging research literature.

We then report structural equation modeling findings that elucidate some important personality, contextual, and performance predictors of BII.

Overall, examination of free association data indicates that Americans are most worried about what they consume and are most "fat" phobic, students (youngest generation) are most inclined towards unhealthy foods and least concerned about the health effects of foods, and that, combining across generations, females are somewhat more concerned about food and health and fat but these effects are smaller than culture or generation effects. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

  abstract = {One possible cause for the higher speed of information processing of more intelligent individuals may be that higher-intelligence scores are associated with higher temporal resolution capacity of the brain. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the potential relationship between timing performance and general fluid intelligence. For this purpose, a sample of 100 participants was divided into a lower-IQ and a higher-IQ group according to below and above median scores on Cattel's Culture Fair Intelligence Test Scale 3. Experimental tasks were duration discrimination of auditory intervals in the range of milliseconds and seconds, temporal-order judgments (TOJ), and auditory flutter fusion (AFF). Performance on duration discrimination of both filled and empty intervals in the range of milliseconds was significantly better for the high-IQ than for the low-IQ group. No IQ-related differences could be shown for temporal discrimination of intervals in the range of seconds, TOJ, and AFF. Furthermore, stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that combining performance on duration discrimination with filled and empty intervals in the range of milliseconds accounted for 22% of the total variance of general fluid intelligence. Findings suggest that brain mechanisms specifically involved in discriminations of extremely brief intervals represent a sensitive indicator of general fluid intelligence. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

To test these hypotheses, 60 undergraduate women interacted with a pre-recorded partner; one-third provided support to an interaction partner (i.e., communion stressor), debated current events (i.e., agency stressor), or described a typical day (i.e., control task). Compared to controls, the debate task evoked greater systolic blood pressure and heart rate reactivity and related autonomic changes. Compared to controls, providing support evoked larger increases in cardiac sympathetic activation and reduced vascular resistance. Low levels of trait agency were associated with greater CVR overall. Hence, agency and communion stressors had distinct psychophysiologic effects. Although both tasks heightened reactivity, the agency task evoked cognitive and physiological responses consistent with threat, whereas the communion task evoked a pattern consistent with challenge. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

To date, however, personality theorists seldom have considered neuropsychological case material (Klein & Kihlstrom, 1998). In this paper we show how neuropsychological evidence can afford new insights for personality theorists. In particular, we show how examination of persons suffering from amnesia and autism can shed light on the way in which knowledge about self is represented in memory. We first review the literature on clinical amnesia and then present evidence from a new case study exploring the relation between personal and nonpersonal knowledge in a patient with autism. We conclude that the mind may have learning systems that are specialized both for acquiring and retrieving information about one's own personality. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Nevertheless, the relation between its two scales, positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA), is still controversial. Previous results that suggest independence between NA and PA were limited to manifest variables. In this study, the relation between PA and NA for both state and trait instructions was analyzed by means of structural equation modeling. Two hundred ninety-two participants responded to the PANAS at three occasions of measurement. No association was found between trait PA and NA, but significant negative correlations between state PA and NA emerged. In the second step, the observed variance of state PA and NA was decomposed into a dispositional component, an occasion-specific component, a method-specific component, and a component due to measurement error by employing a multi-construct latent state-trait model. This analysis confirmed and extended the results of our first analysis: the dispositional components of state PA and NA were unrelated. In contrast, the situation-specific components were negatively associated. Thus, the negative correlation between state PA and NA could be traced back to situation-specific effects. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

In Study 2 (N = 309), the ethnic difference in self-reported shyness was substantially higher for classroom than for social situations. In Study 3 (N = 213), the ethnic difference was strong for cross-ethnicity socializing but nil for same-ethnicity socializing. In Study 4 (N = 250), a behavioral index-classroom participation-was recorded and coded. The observed ethnic difference in participation rate showed a medium effect size comparable to the self-report difference. There was no ethnic difference, however, in the mean complexity and challengingness of the classroom participations or in final course grades. We conclude that the ethnic difference is maximal for classroom participation because the latter situation combines several key contributing factors to Asian shyness. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Study 1 showed that agreeableness and extraversion were associated with both peer acceptance and friendship. Study 2 followed children longitudinally and examined the hypothesis that agreeableness protects children from victimization by peers. Agreeableness was associated with decreased victimization over the school year. In addition, agreeableness moderated the associations between behavioral vulnerabilities and victimization. At low levels of agreeableness, as behavior vulnerabilities increased, victimization increased, and at high levels of agreeableness, there was no association between vulnerabilities and victimization. Results suggest that of the Big Five dimensions, Agreeableness is most closely associated with processes and outcomes related to peer relations in children. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Although individuals from the two cultures reported a strong sense of obligation with regard to close friends and family members, Latinos expressed a greater desire (i.e., greater perceived "want") to engage in these "should" behaviors. Furthermore, compared to Anglos, Latinos felt a stronger sense of both shoulds and wants in their motivations to help more distant family and friends. The two groups did not differ in their motivations to help distant acquaintances and strangers. Although wants were associated with life satisfaction for both groups, shoulds were positively associated with life satisfaction for Latinos but not Anglos. Overall, compared to the Anglo students, Latino students perceived helping others as both more obligatory and more personally desirable, suggesting a more congruent view of personal autonomy and societal control in collectivist cultures than in individualist cultures. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Using the Social Relations Model (Kenny, 1994), it was found that in one-on-one interactions, judges were able to achieve consensus for the targets' traits of extraversion, agreeableness, and openness. For extraversion and openness, this agreement corresponded with targets' self-perceptions. Unlike research using face-to-face interactions, consensus was highest and assimilation was lowest when participants interacted one-on-one. Judges in group interactions tended to like the targets less and viewed them less favorably across all personality traits than did judges in one-on-one interactions. Targets' self-reported personality had little predictive power in determining who was liked in Internet chat rooms.

The current study examined relations between a comprehensive measure of personality, the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, and condom use and other HIV risk behaviors. The study sample consisted of 201 disadvantaged, primarily African American participants of an HIV risk reduction program in the Arkansas delta region. The sample was stratified into three risk groups. The low-risk group (n = 43) had 0% engaging in various risky sexual and substance use practices. Between 3% and 52% of the high-risk group (n = 62) engaged in these practices (e.g., shared needles, sex with partner who shoots drugs, received anal sex). The medium-risk group (n = 96) was intermediate. Results indicated that high Neuroticism, low Conscientiousness, and low Agreeableness are associated with HIV risk behaviors. Thus, high-risk behavior is associated with emotional distress, poor self-control, and hostile and antagonistic attitudes and behaviors. The high-risk group differed from the medium- and low-risk groups on the Neuroticism facet of Impulsiveness, indicating an inability to resist cravings and urges. The high-risk group also scored lower in Competence (i.e., feelings of self-efficacy), Self-Discipline (i.e., motivation to carry tasks through to completion), and Achievement Striving (i.e., aspiration levels). The current study, by identifying several personality traits that contribute to sexual risk behavior, raises important public health implications. Successful intervention in these AIDS-related behaviors may require interventions tailored to these basic tendencies.

However, although the Big Five factors are held to be orthogonal, they are not orthogonal in previous marker sets developed for them. The author describes methods for creating relatively orthogonal marker sets for orthogonal factors and demonstrates that the Big Five can be operationalized in relatively orthogonal marker scales. The three marker sets presented are a 40-item short form of Goldberg's 100 unipolar markers (Ortho-Markers), a new set of Modular Markers built with item parcels, and a 40-item short form of these (Mini-Modular Markers [the 3M40]). The new Big Five marker sets are shown to have markedly lower interscale correlations, with no loss of validity, relative to previous marker sets with comparable numbers of items. This indicates that the nonorthogonality of previous Big Five marker scales is less a property of the Big Five model than an unintended outcome of commonly used scale construction procedures. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Included in this effort are a review of four major conceptualizations of art, an attempt to bridge art and personality theory by proposing that what applies to paintings applies to people and vice-versa, the presentation of evidence in support of "theory of response" being common to both the perception of art and person perception, and a recasting of the nature of "self" as an emotion. Following theoretical and methodological discussion of a proposed multiplex conceptualization of personality deriving from an adaptation of a Brunswikian lens model, an effort is made to consider the manner in which the empiricism characteristic of personality research might be applied in the historically nonempirical study of painting and sculpture. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

The first approach yields M-F as a bipolar trait that overlaps substantially with the People-Things dimension of vocational interests, and the second yields M primarily as instrumentality (or agency) and F as expressiveness (or communion). In the present model M-F, M, and F are each cohesive trait dimensions that show substantial discriminant validity from one another. M-F correlates with a number of important criteria, including self- and other-rated M-F, sexual orientation, transsexual vs nontranssexual status, scholastic aptitude and achievement, mortality risk, and social dominance and prejudice in men. M (instrumentality) and F (expressiveness) correlate most strongly with interpersonal kinds of behavior and adjustment.

Sixty participants were administered the Desirability of Control Scale and filled out a questionnaire assessing their tendency to form causal relations under low- and high-stress conditions. It was found that the difference in the formation of causal relations between high-DC individuals and low-DC individuals was greater in the high-stress than in the low-stress condition.

One hypothesis that has received the most attention to date is the view that characteristic attributes that an individual regards as especially important for his or her self-concepts exert the greatest influence on self-esteem. In an investigation of this hypothesis, 375 college undergraduates completed measures of global self-esteem as well as rating scales that assessed self-concepts and the importance attached to these self-concepts in the maintenance of self-esteem. The self-concept and importance domains examined corresponded to the five-factor model (FFM) personality dimensions. Consistent with previous research, importance ratings attached to self-concepts were not found to moderate the relation between self-concepts and self-esteem. Rather, ratings on self-concepts alone accounted for a substantial proportion of variance (53.3%) in self-esteem scores. Bivariate correlations based on FFM dimension scores and self-esteem scores revealed consistent positive associations. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that among the FFM dimensions, self-concept ratings for emotional stability (vs neuroticism), extraversion, and agreeableness significantly predicted self-esteem. © 2001 Academic Press.},

The narratives came from interviews at 6 months post-loss. The narrative self-evaluation variables were compared to separate clinical interview measures of grief at 6, 14, and 25 months post-loss. As predicted, narrative descriptions of self-efficacy (i.e., overt evaluations of one's abilities) predicted less grief over time, even when controlling for perceptions of actually doing well and being good. Furthermore, self-efficacy appeared to neutralize the ill effects of negatively evaluating one's behaviors but not one's characteristics.

Twice a week for up to 10 weeks, 103 participants provided measures of their daily empathy and mood (NA and PA) and described the events that occurred each day. Multilevel random coefficient modeling analyses found that daily empathy covaried positively with the impact of daily positive and negative social events and with daily positive and negative effect. Empathy did not covary with achievement-related events. Analyses that simultaneously included empathy, mood, and events suggested that daily NA mediated relationships between daily empathy and daily negative social events. Although mean daily empathy was positively related to trait empathy, trait empathy did not moderate relationships between daily empathy and events nor between daily empathy and mood. Moreover, daily empathy did not covary with daily depressogenic thinking, need for cognition, nor self-esteem, suggesting that empathy is distinct from these constructs. Possible mechanisms linking social events and empathy, such as emotional contagion, are discussed. © 2001 Academic Press.},

Data were collected over the Internet from a large heterogeneous sample of individuals who ranged in age from 9 to 90 years (N = 326,641). Collectively, the Big Five accounted for 34% of the variance in self-esteem. High self-esteem individuals were emotionally stable, extraverted, and conscientious and were somewhat agreeable and open to experience. Despite an extensive search for potential mediators and moderators of this general pattern, the relations between self-esteem and the Big Five largely cut across age, sex, social class, ethnicity, and nationality (United States vs non-United States). High self-esteem individuals tended to ascribe socially desirable traits to themselves, and this tendency partially mediated relations between the Big Five and self-esteem. Discussion focuses on interpreting the social desirability effects, limitations of the study, and directions for future research. © 2001 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {Among the most popular measures of aggression is the 29-item, self-report Aggression Questionnaire (AQ; Buss & Perry, 1992; Buss & Warren, 2000). Structural analyses of the AQ have revealed four underlying factors: Physical Aggression, Verbal Aggression, Anger, and Hostility. However, these four factors explain too little common variance (i.e., about 80%) to be an adequate measurement model. In the present study, we used confirmatory factor analysis with a total sample of 1154 respondents to compare four alternative measurement models for the AQ that are currently in use. Replicating earlier work, none of these models fit the data well, and the original four-factor model achieved only mediocre goodness-of-fit in three independent samples (GFI =.76 -.81). To develop a more appropriate measurement model, we omitted items with low loadings or multiple loadings based on principal components analysis and excluded items with reverse-scored wording. This yielded a 12-item, four-factor measurement model with acceptable goodness-of-fit (GFI =.94). Secondary analysis of two independent data sets confirmed the refined model’s generalizability for British (Archer, Holloway, & McLoughlin, 1995; GFI =.93) and Canadian (Harris, 1995; GFI =.94) samples. The refined model yielded equivalent factor structures for males and females in all three samples. We also replicated the refined four-factor model in two additional American samples, who completed a new short form of the AQ containing only the subset of 12 items in random order. Additional analyses provided evidence supporting the model’s construct validity and demonstrated stronger discriminant validity for the refined Hostility factor compared to its predecessor. The new short form of the AQ thus not only contains fewer than half as many items as the original, but also is psychometrically superior. © 2001 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {The tendency to self-enhance has been related to a host of beneficial psychological outcomes (Taylor & Brown, 1988), although some negative social consequences have also been identified (Colvin et al., 1995, Paulhus, 1998). One operationalization of self-enhancement is derived by subtracting the rater's evaluations of others from his or her self-ratings to yield a measure of the rater's sense of superiority/inferiority, i.e., rater-derived self-enhancement. The present research assessed the psychological and social correlates of a person's sense of superiority in groups whose members worked on tasks together for 3 months. A sense of superiority was scored as a composite but also separated into its two components, self-regard and regard for others, to determine if these components of a sense of superiority have separate relationships to psychological and social processes. A sense of superiority evidenced the same self-rated psychological benefits as had been found in Western research, though it showed both positive and negative social outcomes, as assessed on an eight-factor measure of the target's personality rated by his or her other group members. Positive psychological characteristics and a stereotypically masculine reputation were associated with higher levels of self-regard; lower levels of self-rated Agreeableness, a stereotypically nonfeminine reputation, and lower liking were associated with lower levels of regard for others. Given their different functions, it is proposed that self-regard and regard for others be separated in future research and attention directed toward characterizing the behavioral profiles of those high and low in these two measures of basic personality orientation. © 2000 Academic Press.},

This study examined children with borderline features (n = 21) using the Coolidge Personality and Neuropsychological Inventory for Children and compared them to controls (n = 21) with features of at least one personality disorder, but not BPD. As hypothesized, the BPD group scored significantly higher than the control group on the Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Executive Functions Deficits, Mild Neurocognitive Disorder, Conduct Disorder, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder scales. It appears that behavioral disturbances associated with BPD are linked strongly with neuropsychological dysfunction. Because none of the children with BPD features in the present sample had a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), it appears likely that TBI in the histories of adult BPD patients may not be the cause of BPD, but traits such as anger and impulsivity in BPD may cause TBI.

Interviewer and actor gender was crossed, resulting in four videotaped interviews representing all possible interviewer/actor gender combinations. Trained male and female coders, who were blind to the experimental hypotheses, rated the actors as displaying identical levels of hostile verbal and nonverbal expression. One hundred five male and 116 female Caucasian undergraduate participants then rated the four videotaped interviews for hostility expression levels in a counterbalanced order. Main effects were found for actor gender; female actors were rated as significantly more nonverbally hostile and as less verbally hostile than male actors. No main effects were found for either participant or interviewer gender. It may be that when women display nonverbal hostility, and men display verbal hostility, they are perceived as violating social expectancies and rules, and these deviations from gender-specific expectancies result in a perception of increased hostility. © 2000 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {Undergraduate students in engineering and science completed the Thematic Apperception Test, which was scored for achievement motivation and also for power motivation. They later participated in an experiment in which they first provided a solution to an engineering problem. The experimenter then gave them preprogrammed, written feedback on how well they performed in two conditions of the experiment (positive or negative feedback) and no feedback in a third condition. Feedback was couched in the language of both achievement and power imagery. Last, students rendered solutions to a second engineering problem - the water-for-Tonya problem. Two students who had completed a course in the psychology of creativity performed ratings of each solution on dimensions designated as creativity and complexity. Ratings for the two dimensions moderately correlated with one another (r =. 62) and therefore were combined and summed across the two evaluators to form a single overall Creativity score. Achievement motivation correlated positively with Creativity score in the positive- and negative-feedback conditions (rs =. 43 and. 38) but not significantly in the no-feedback condition (r =. 10). Power motivation correlated positively with Creativity in the positive-feedback condition (r =. 32), and negatively in the negative-feedback condition (r = -.25), but not significantly in the no-feedback condition (r =. 17). Multiple regression/correlation analysis lent further support to these findings. A major conclusion that these data suggest is a differential response to negative feedback. Achievement-motivated people appear to benefit from it, whereas power-motivated people do not. © 2000 Academic Press.},

The assignment of different communication roles is examined as a possible manipulation of self-complexity. In Experiment 1, participants who expected to transmit information about themselves (transmit group) had lower self-complexity than participants who expected to receive information about themselves (receive group). In Experiment 2, an additional communication role condition was included as a control group. Following the self-complexity manipulation and assessment, we observed affective reactions to feedback on academic ability. The mean self-complexity of the receive and control groups did not differ, and both exceeded the mean of the transmit group. Affective reactivity did not differ among the groups and was not significantly correlated with self-complexity. The implications of the self-complexity manipulation are discussed in terms of the flexibility and functionality of self-concept structure. © 2000 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {Previous literature suggests three criticisms of hardiness research: (1) redundancy between hardiness and neuroticism, (2) inappropriate tests of hardiness hypotheses, and (3) a lack of support for hypothesized effects of hardiness. Psychometric concerns underlie these criticisms. Specifically, current hardiness measures rely extensively on negatively worded items, which may lead to redundancy with neuroticism, ambiguous factor structures, and attenuated criterion-related validity coefficients. Alternately, negative hardiness items may measure separate, but hardiness-related cognitive processes. In Study 1 (N = 254), a series of confirmatory factor analyses suggested that positively worded hardiness items are distinct from neuroticism and hierarchically structured with three subdimensions nested under a second-order factor. However, the analyses were equivocal concerning whether negatively worded items measure hardiness or neuroticism. In Study 2 (N =426), we examined the implications of the structural findings for criterion-related validity. A replication of Study 1 suggested support for a model in which negatively worded hardiness items are redundant with neuroticism. Regression analyses indicated that hardiness subdimensions predict health and academic performance criteria above and beyond the global dimension and that positive and negatively worded hardiness items predict different health outcomes, even after controlling for a measure of neuroticism. Weak support was obtained for hardiness as a buffer of the stress-outcome relationship. Funk's (1992) suggested agenda for hardiness research is used as a framework to discuss these findings. © 2000 Academic Press.},

It was hypothesized, on the basis of previous research suggesting that people higher in decisional procrastination have a higher threshold for certainty before making a decision, that participants higher in decisional procrastination would not only take longer to complete the task, but also would seek more information about an alternative eventually chosen before making a decision. Participants, who had previously completed a decisional procrastination scale, were instructed within a behavioral process paradigm to search information about alternative choices on a decision-making task involving the selection of college courses. The number of dimensions (four vs six) and number of alternatives (two vs five) were systematically varied. The results provided convergent evidence with descriptive studies suggesting that rather than being unsystematic and easily distracted in their information searches, people higher in decisional procrastination are systematic and strategic but search for more information specifically about chosen alternatives.

And, (3), Are the correlates between changes in dispositional well-being and role quality dependent on the method one uses to calculate change scores? Three out of four measures of dispositional well-being showed little or no mean-level change from age 21 to age 52. The fourth measure of dispositional well-being, reflecting effective functioning or maturity, showed a statistically significant but substantively small increase over the same 30-year period. The relation between change in dispositional well-being and role-quality was tested across the 30-year span of the longitudinal study. The results showed that positive role-quality was associated with increases on measures of effective functioning and well-being and decreases on measures of anxiety and psychoneuroticism.

In two studies, participants (Study 1, 40 women and 19 men; Study 2, 48 women and 40 men) rated themselves on a measure of chronic procrastination in a general testing session. When participants reported individually to a laboratory, they were told that their performance on a math task would be measured. However, participants were allowed to practice the task or engage in other, fun activities (e.g., playing with a video game or working on a puzzle) for 15 min; hence, "procrastinate" at practicing. Participants in the first study spent an average of 9 of 15 min (60% of the time) procrastinating by working on all activities except practicing math problems. In the second study, where the exact same math task was identified as a fun game, chronic procrastinators did not practice less than nonprocrastinators, suggesting that procrastination (lack of practice) occurs as a behavioral self-handicap. In both studies, when the task was identified as an important evaluation of cognitive skills, chronic procrastinators compared to nonprocrastinators spent more time on the fun, alternative tasks and less time preparing for the evaluation. Procrastination by lack of practicing on a task occurred only when the task was identified as evaluative, not when the identical task was labeled as a fun or pleasurable activity. © 2000 Academic Press.},

We found seven sexual dimensions of person description - Sexual Attractiveness, Relationship Exclusivity, Gender Orientation, Sexual Restraint, Erotophilic Disposition, Emotional Investment, and Sexual Orientation - based on self-ratings of 67 sexuality adjectives made by women (n = 217) and men (n = 150) and on observer-ratings of the opposite sex (n = 207). The seven sexuality factor scales displayed moderate to high levels construct validity and were modestly correlated with the Big Five. However, we argue that the sexuality factors are best viewed as a reapportionment of general personality variation along seven sex-specific and evolution-relevant dimensions of individual differences. Finally, significant sex differences existed on four of the seven sexuality factors.

The results did not support the presence of large cross-cultural or gender differences in response biases. Moderate to high agreement was found between different indexes of the same biases. Participants' response bias tendencies were moderately stable across instruments. Controlling for response biases led to trivial changes in effect sizes; in most cases, conclusions about cultural differences in personality constructs did not change. Most hypotheses relating personality variables to response biases were not supported. © 1999 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a new control construct, harmony control (HC), inspired by a reanalysis of Rothbaum, Weisz, and Snyder's (1982) primary and secondary control constructs. Traditional primary control, and its supporting construct secondary control, affirm the Western cultural emphasis on an agentic self that separates positively from others. Harmony control reflects an interdependent self-concept. In HC, people are flexible and adjusting, and they recognize the agency that resides in spiritual and social forces. Guided by culturally informed views of the interdependent self and previously defined categories of secondary control, the present research develops an individual difference measure of HC framed independently of traditional primary and secondary control. Results from over 2300 community and student participants show that the scale meets traditional psychometric standards for reliability and predictive validity. As predicted, HC correlates with interdependence and collectivism and is orthogonal to two measures of traditional primary control. HC is uncorrelated with self-esteem, suggesting that harmony control may not engage self-efficacy because the social context is more in focus than the self. Women and Hispanics, two groups for whom role requirements and cultural background emphasize interdependence and harmony, score higher than men and Anglos, respectively. In a laboratory study, people higher in HC were more likely to transfer decision power to another person or to chance. © 1999 Academic Press.},

When asked to describe their ideal partner in Study 3, very few women identified dominant as a desirable trait. However, several traits associated with dominance, such as assertiveness and confidence, were selected.

Tasks assessed participant-determined degree of exposure (looking at, picking up, touching, and in some cases eating) to objects such as a cockroach, cremated ashes, and a freshly killed pig's head and to disgusting video clips (seconds watching). These tasks elicited strong negative affect in a way that was ethical and not very disturbing to participants; they may be useful for future laboratory study of emotion. Participants also experienced nondisgusting control tasks, such as imitating a chicken or holding one's hand in ice-water. Analysis of task intercorrelations indicated four factors: food-related disgust, body-violation-and-death-related disgust, compliance motivation, and embarrassability. Only the two disgust factors correlated significantly with the paper-and-pencil Disgust Scale; a combination of the two correlated .58 with Disgust Scale scores obtained months before the laboratory assessment and correlated .71 with scores obtained immediately after this assessment. Most generally, these results are a reminder that there is no gold standard for personality assessment. As with paper-and-pencil measures, behavioral measures require getting beyond face validity to assess threats to validity from factors such as embarrassment and compliance motivation. © 1999 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {Although hostility and social support are closely related, these risk factors for cardiovascular disease and premature death are typically considered separately. Interpersonal approaches to personality and social relations (Kiesler, 1996) provide models and methods for examining the interrelation of these constructs. The current study used the interpersonal approach to identify and describe groups of individuals varying on hostility and social support. In two samples of undergraduate men and women, replicated cluster analyses revealed three distinct patterns of psychosocial risk. An affiliative (i.e., "low-risk") group was characterized by low hostility and high social support. This group displayed a friendly interpersonal style on a measure of the five-factor model that incorporates the interpersonal circumplex. On a related measure of parental representations, the low-risk group reported pervasively affiliative interactions with their mothers and fathers as well as a secure adult attachment style. A hostile group was characterized by higher levels of hostility and high social support. These individuals presented a more hostile interpersonal style and higher levels of neuroticism, but reported typically affiliative interactions with parents and a secure attachment style. Finally, a hostile-isolated group was distinguished by elevated hostility and low social support. These subjects displayed a hostile-submissive interpersonal style as well as higher levels of neuroticism. They also reported more hostile and fewer friendly interactions with their parents and an insecure adult attachment style. These findings illustrate the potential value of examining naturally occurring patterns of psychosocial risk. Because the interpersonal approach allows the description of personality traits and interpersonal processes in a common conceptual language, it may be a particularly useful methodology in this regard. © 1999 Academic Press.},

The grid technique and its situational and personality constituents are described in detail. Factor analyses of the statements all recommend the adoption of a three-factor solution in which one hope-of-success and two fear-of-failure concepts are differentiated. Reliability and validity studies demonstrate that the grid technique is a psychometrically sound measure of the achievement motive and that it possesses substantial construct validity. Behavioral differences found in regard to performance and persistence can easily be integrated into an achievement motivation nomological network. Furthermore, the effectiveness of motive-modification programs in schools can be documented using the grid technique. © 1999 Academic Press.},

Results showed that measurement properties of personality scales were only minimally affected by instructional variation. Most importantly, present retrospections of past lifetime personality and anticipations of future lifetime personality predicted unique variance in a variety of current-day outcomes beyond that predicted by standard self-reports of present-day personality. © 1998 Academic Press.},

The results of the model fitting agreed with other recent studies in showing the Big Five dimensions to be substantially and about equally heritable, with little or no contribution of shared family environment.

For Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, some effect of shared environment was found for measure-specific variance on the personality inventory, and for Extraversion and Neuroticism, models involving nonadditive genetic variance or twin contrast effects provided slightly better fits. © 1998 Academic Press.},

Self-reports on brief measures of Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness in a national sample (N= 9664) were unrelated to birth order. Self-reports on the 30 facet scales of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) in an adult sample (N= 612) showed only small effects for Altruism and Tender-Mindedness. Peer ratings (N= 166) supported the hypotheses that laterborn children would be higher in facets of Openness and Agreeableness, but spouse ratings (N= 88) did not replicate those findings. Birth order may have subtle effects on perceived personality, but it is unlikely that this effect mediates associations with scientific radicalism. © 1998 Academic Press.},

The less optimistic women were more psychologically impaired by losing their jobs. Among the unemployed women, the more optimistic ones and those who were more able to distance themselves from job loss fared better. Nevertheless, coping did not mediate the connection between optimism and psychological outcomes. These findings suggest that optimism is an important personal resource for coping with unemployment in Hong Kong Chinese, but whether coping mediates the effects of optimism on psychological health or not depends on other contextual factors.

In the male groups, there was assimilation for judgments of dominance and friendliness, but no consensus. Self-other agreement occurred for dominant, hostile, and friendly in the female groups so that, for instance, women who saw themselves as friendly were likely to be seen as friendly by the other members of their group. Both men and women who rated themselves as friendly assumed that others were also friendly, and the men who rated themselves as hostile assumed that others were hostile.

This study utilized brainstem auditory evoked responses (ABRs) to investigate which trait (extraversion, impulsivity, sociability) is most closely related to hypothesized ascending reticular activating system-regulated arousal processes. The results indicated that the full scale of extraversion was related to ABR wave V activity,r= .27,p< .025, with extraverts exhibiting slower ABR latencies compared to introverts.

A substantial match was obtained between the factor structure of longitudinal correlations that had been averaged across participants and the factor structure of individual differences. For individual participants, this factor match was worse. It is concluded that the Big Five are useful to describe longitudinal variations in states.

Negative affect emerged as a predictor of the amount of conflict that characterized people's past romantic relationships. Analyses further revealed that the link between PA and relationship quality was mediated by high PA individuals' reluctance to engage in active destructive responses and propensity to engage in active, constructive responses to conflict with their partner. © 1997 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {The construction and properties of the Belief in Good Luck (BIGL) Scale are described. Three studies provide evidence that reliable individual differences exist with respect to beliefs about luck. Some individuals maintain an irrational view of luck as a somewhat stable force that tends to influence events in their own favor, while others seem to hold the more rational belief that luck is random and unreliable. Further, these beliefs showed a considerable amount of stability over time. The BIGL was significantly related to locus of control (primarily to a chance subscale), but other evidence suggested these constructs were distinct. Belief in good luck was not related to general optimism, academic pessimism, self-esteem, desire for control, or achievement motivation. There was also evidence that belief in good luck was distinct from feeling fortunate or generally satisfied with one's life. Ethnic group differences were observed for the BIGL scale, showing that Asian-Americans were more likely to endorse superstitious beliefs about luck than non-Asians. Finally, the BIGL scale was shown to predict positive expectations for the outcome of everyday situations that are typically associated with luck. This is generally in agreement with previous findings suggesting that people who believe in personal good luck react to lucky events by becoming more positive about the likelihood of future success (Darke & Freedman, 1997). In general, it is suggested that irrational beliefs about luck can serve as a source of positive expectations for the outcome of future events. © 1997 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {In five consecutive stressful tasks we examined the role of humor as a potential stress moderator using systolic and diastolic blood pressure as an indication of cardiovascular reactivity. In all five tasks, the Coping Humor Scale interacted with sex in the prediction of blood pressure. The same pattern was found in response to each of the five tasks: Females who were higher in coping humor exhibited lower systolic blood pressure than females scoring lower on coping humor, while the reverse characterized males; males who scored high on the coping humor scale exhibited higher systolic blood pressure than males scoring low on that scale. Similar though less robust results were found when the Situational Humor Response Questionnaire was used as the measure of humor. In the Cold Pressor Task, which involves pain and endurance, interactions were found between humor, sex, and trials indicating a stress-moderator effect. The absence of interactions indicating stress moderation in most of the analyses with the other four stress tasks suggests that humor may play more of a role in moderating the impact of uncontrollable and passively experienced stressors. Tasks requiring more active, problem-solving behavior may be less amenable to the beneficial effects of humor. The findings do not clearly resolve the questions about the role of humor in effecting responses to stress. However, they do suggest that the subjects' sex may be an important consideration when evaluating the impact of humor as a stress moderator. © 1997 Academic Press.},

Study 2 extended this finding in a new sample by showing that individuals who primarily use a normative style of processing identity-relevant information devised the least individualistic photo essays whereas those with an information-oriented style devised the most individualistic photo essays.

The second set of issues involved several previously unanswered questions derived from the trust literature, specifically: (a) the comparability of competing measures of trust, (b) the convergence between trust in specific people vs trust in human nature, and (c) whether trust is more closely related to one's personality or emotions or to the quality of one's relationships. Results generally supported the validity of the Trust Inventory and its tripartite division of types of trust including the new concept of Network Trust. In addition, various measures of trust were moderately to strongly interrelated.

Measures of relational trust were significantly more strongly related to relationship quality and commitment, whereas measures of global trust were slightly more strongly related to indices of personality and emotion.

Toward this end, we used correlation, multiple regression, and path analysis to examine the associations of sociosexuality with: (1) the normal-range personality traits of the five-factor model, (2) a sexual attitude\affect dimension called erotophobia-erotophilia, and (3) ego development. The sample consisted of 350 Asian and Caucasian college students. Our final path model indicated that, regardless of ethnicity, extroversion, low agreeableness, and erotophilia were direct predictors of unrestricted sociosexuality. Furthermore, openness was an indirect predictor of sociosexuality through its association with erotophilia. However, our final path model also included ethnic differences. Specifically, in the Caucasian sample low agreeableness and openness were significant predictors of erotophilia, but in the Asian sample low neuroticism and openness combined to predict erotophilia. Finally, an interaction was observed between ethnicity and ego development in predicting unrestricted sociosexuality. For our Caucasian sample, increases in ego development were negatively correlated with unrestricted sociosexuality, while for Asians, increasing levels of ego development were not associated with sociosexuality. In other words, as ego development increases, Caucasians become more like Asians in that they are more sexually constrained or restricted. In the conclusion, we offer explanations of the results and discuss findings in terms of several theories of human sexual behavior. © 1997 Academic Press.},

Factor analysis showed that the chimpanzee ratings were accurately described by six factors, five of which resembled the human Big Five. The sixth factor was dominance related and was consistent with the central role of dominance in chimpanzee personality. Convergent and discriminant validity of the factor structure was excellent.

  abstract = {Recently a consensus has developed that the Big Five traits of personality (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness) are an adequate taxonomy of individual difference traits. However, despite this consensus and the often impressive predictive results of trait research, very little research has been done on a key question - How do traits work at the level of proximal mental processes to causally determine behavior? We argue that the constructs of the cognitive approach to personality (e.g., beliefs, expectancies, and subjective values) can be used to provide proximal, causal explanations of individual differences. Two studies are reported demonstrating the initial steps in this effort. Study 1 (N= 83) used think-aloud assessment techniques to measure the beliefs of subjects. These interviewer-assessed beliefs were then shown to be significantly correlated with individual differences in standard self-report personality questionnaires. Study 2 assessed subjects' (N= 86) beliefs via a self-report measure and found beliefs to be significantly correlated with scores on standard personality questionnaires. We argue that individual differences along the broad trait dimensions of the Big Five can be explained via individual differences in general beliefs people hold about themselves and the social world.

When equal numbers of positive and negative life events were eligible for recall, well-being was unrelated to the relative likelihood of recalling the two types of events. Phase 2 suggested that life events are organized in memory according to the domain in which they occur but not according to their valence. However, neither the organization nor the retrieval of life events correlated with well-being.

Factor scores on this acquiescence factor were related to cognitive simplicity, rigid mental organization, and intolerance of alternatives, but not to socially desirable responding or other social concerns. These results imply that acquiescence is more of a cognitive style than a social response. © 1997 Academic Press.},

It was shown that various criterion groups (inhabitants of an isolated island, housewives with many children, servicemen, old members of sororities, etc.) have remarkably different patterns of collectivism: one group can be highly collectivistic in one domain of social relations and on the average level in some other domain. The different types of collectivism were also selectively associated with the results of the "I am . . ." Test and the Schwartz values questionnaire. Both hierarchical and confirmatory factor analysis revealed that these three sufficiently distinct types of collectivism share a common core which is superordinate to these particular forms of collectivism. This general, higher-order collectivism factor that likely affects all types of collectivism is related to two of the Big Five personality domains, Openness and Agreeableness, measured by the NEO Personality Inventory. Agreeable persons, who are also closed to experience, are comparatively more predisposed to absorb collectivistic elements from the culture into their own cognitive schemes. About one-third of the total variance of the measures of collectivism can be predicted from the measures of personality. This large proportion suggests that different collectivistic orientations have a common root in the relatively stable personality traits. © 1997 Academic Press.},

Second, we correlated self-concept with a depressive symptom measure from which overlapping content had been removed. Third, we related self-concept to positive and negative affectivity (PA, NA). Specificity to depression suggests that low self-concept should be associated with low PA, whereas its inclusion in the proposed criteria for mixed anxiety-depression (Zinbarg et al., 1994) implied that low self-esteem should be linked especially to high NA. Results indicate that self-esteem was (a) inversely correlated with depressive symptoms, (b) specific to depressive symptoms, and (c) correlated more highly with PA than with NA. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

In addition, the present research also tested predictions from self-regulation models that would suggest that personality factors may interact to account for unique variance in depression and health symptoms. A total of 179 students (77 men, 102 women) completed measures of perfectionism, self-efficacy, procrastination, health symptoms, and depression. Correlational analyses revealed that depression scores were related to socially prescribed perfectionism, self-efficacy dimensions, and procrastination. Physical symptom report was associated with personal and social dimensions of perfectionism, low self-efficacy, and depression. Regression results indicated that self-efficacy and socially prescribed perfectionism interacted to predict unique variance in depression and physical symptom report. The results provided partial support for the application of a self-regulation model to the study of psychological distress and somatic problems in college students.

To demonstrate this postulate, participants completed a self-report measure of emotion inhibition, underwent a stressful interpersonal task during which blood pressure reactivity was recorded, and then were rated for observed emotion inhibition. As expected, observational and self-reports of emotion inhibition appeared to assess differing tendencies, but both additively predicted cardiovascular reactivity.

Whereas the self is conceptualized as an organized system of personal meanings, a value crisis is defined as a disorganization of this system. Personal meanings were investigated using a self-confrontation method that is sensitive to the affective properties of personal meanings and their organization into a composite whole. Three groups of students were compared, one high, one medium, and one low in value crisis. Results indicate that the high crisis group had a lower level of intensity of affect referring to self-enhancement, a lower intensity level of affect referring to contact and union with the other, and a lower level of positive affect in comparison with the other groups. In addition, negative meanings were more generalizing in the self of subjects in crisis, whereas positive meanings were more generalizing in the self system of those not in crisis. Moreover, people in crisis showed more discontinuity between their past and future than those not in crisis. Special emphasis was placed on the specific affective organization of subjects in crisis. Two idiographic case studies were presented to illustrate meaningful exceptions to the rule. It was concluded that value crisis is an "in-between state" involving the risk of disorganization of the self, but at the same time including opportunities for innovative self-development. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Such a motivational analysis allows us to express coherent cognition-affect-behavior patterns that distinguish individuals from each other. However, because it also illuminates the underpinnings of important psychological phenomena in all individuals (e.g., helplessness, aggression), this analysis would be of interest even if everyone had the same personality. I illustrate these points by identifying major classes of goals and the cognition-affect-behavior patterns that are associated with them.

  issn = {00926566},
  abstract = {The future of personality psychology may be viewed from three different vantage points, each representing a relatively distinct level or domain within which human individuality may be described and explained. From the first vantage point of dispositional traits, the significant conceptual and empirical advances of the 1980s should lead to continued consolidation of the trait concept in the years to come and the vigorous expansion of the application of trait schemes, especially the Big Five, to a wide range of fields and phenomena. It is possible, however, to envision a less optimistic alternative future for the trait concept, should trait researchers fall prey to the kind of parochialism that has sometimes characterized personality research in years past. Beyond traits, personal concerns encompass many motivational, developmental, and strategic constructs of personality that are contextualized in time, place, and/or social role. The recent upsurge of interest in such constructs as personal strivings, life tasks, and so on suggests that the study of human individuality from this second vantage point should witness considerable proliferation in construct development during the next few years as well as integrative attempts to map the geography of this vast and variegated personality domain. The third vantage point is that of identity as a life story, a perspective articulated in a number of relatively new personality theories. According to this perspective, most adults living in modern societies seek to provide their lives with unity and purpose by constructing internalized and evolving life narratives complete with settings, scenes, characters, plots, and themes. Personality psychologists have just begun to consider individuality from this third vantage point. It is hoped that future years will witness a significant research effort to collect, interpret, categorize, and analyze life stories and to explore their structure, function, and development in order to better understand their role and their position within the complexity of personality. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Thus, the field of SWB is used to explore under what circumstances personality traits are likely to be important. Because of the strong influence of traits on SWB and a resurgence of interest in the "Big Five" system of traits, the area offers an excellent object lesson in the pitfalls of a personality psychology that relies exclusively on trait constructs. It is shown that even when traits offer strong predictions, they do not offer a complete account of psychological phenomena. It is concluded, however, that traits can be very important organizing structures with which to initially classify and understand some important phenomena of psychology. At the same time, scientific understanding based on traits must be augmented by a process orientation and a study of relevant situational factors in order for the field of personality to remain an intellectually vigorous science. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

The article contrasts the FFM with an alternative model of personality derived in part from clinical observation and interpretation of narratives, which can be quantified using Q-sort methodology.

  abstract = {Hypermasculinity and hyperfemininity are two gender-specific personality dimensions that represent adherence to extremely traditional gender-role ideologies. The present studies were conducted to develop and validate a gender-neutral measure of adherence to these extreme Stereotypic gender beliefs. From a pool of 142 potential items, item analyses resulted in an internally consistent 57-item Hypergender Ideology Scale (HGIS) that was significantly, positively correlated with hypermasculinity and hyperfemininity. Moreover, the HGIS was strongly correlated with scales that were used to validate measures of hypermasculinity and hyperfemininity. Implications for the study of adherence to Stereotypic gender roles, and of hypergender ideology as a personality constellation independent of gender, are discussed. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Larsen (1984) developed the Affect Intensity Measure (AIM) as a measure of a theoretical unidimensional construct referred to as affect intensity, or the characteristic strength with which people experience emotions. Study 1 investigated the goodness-of-fit of five different measurement models of the AIM, using two independent samples of undergraduates (Ns = 673 and 631). For both samples, the best-fitting model consisted of three factors (Positive Affectivity, Negative Intensity, Negative Reactivity) that explained roughly 80% of the common variance in responses to a subset of 27 AIM items. Additional analyses revealed that women scored higher on Negative Reactivity than did men and were more emotionally reactive to negative stimuli than to positive, whereas men were more reactive to positive stimuli than to negative. These gender differences are explained in terms of differential socialization, which makes females more willing or able to express negative emotions relative to males. Study 2 assessed the discriminant validity of the three-factor model, relative to unidimensional AIM total score, in predicting dimensions of dispositional empathy as measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1983). The three AIM factors together explained more variance in dispositional empathy than did AIM total score, with the increase in R2 ranging from a low of 8% (for Fantasy) to a high of 125% (for Perspective Taking). Demonstrating discriminant validity, each AIM factor showed a different pattern of relations with the IRI subscales, and Negative Reactivity was more strongly predictive of dispositional empathy than were the other two AIM factors. These results corroborate the multidimensionality of affect intensity and highlight the importance of distinguishing between the characteristic strength of negative emotions when they are experienced (i.e., dispositional intensity) and the characteristic strength of emotions expressed in response to aversive stimuli (i.e., dispositional reactivity). © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Seventy-five subjects completed measures of verbal creative ability and openness to experience and listed their creative accomplishments. Openness to experience and extraversion were positively correlated with creative ability, controlling for measures of academic ability. Agreeableness was negatively correlated with creative accomplishments. Both verbal creativity and openness had significant positive correlations with creative accomplishments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that these relations were qualified by significant creative ability by openness and creative ability by conscientiousness interactions. At high levels of openness, creative ability shared a positive linear relation with accomplishments. Individuals high in creative ability but low on openness to experience reported relatively few creative accomplishments. In contrast, conscientiousness was related to heightened accomplishments by individuals low in creative talent. Results are interpreted as illustrating the interplay of abilities and traits in promoting creative behavior. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Regression analyses indicated that optimism and locus of control were relatively independent predictors of control appraisals and that control appraisals were generally better predictors of coping than either locus of control or optimism. As expected, somewhat different patterns of significant predictors were obtained for the three stressors. Results are discussed in terms of the congruence model of effective coping, which predicts relations among control appraisals and coping for various types of stressful situations. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

The disliking-by-association hypothesis is that associates of those low in positive affect (PA) would be negatively evaluated themselves because of their relation to a low PA person. The liking-by-contrast hypothesis asserts that associates of low PA people will be more positively appraised due to the social contrast. Undergraduates (targets) and their roommates were videotaped during a brief interaction and later completed questionnaires on positive and negative affectivity. A panel of judges rated the videotapes for the degree to which they liked participants. These ratings served as an index of likeability. Targets were negatively evaluated if their roommates were high in PA, particularly if the targets were low in PA. By contrast, targets with low PA roommates were more positively appraised. Thus, the liking-by-contrast hypothesis garnered more support than the disliking-by-association perspective. These results were specific to trait PA vs trait negative affectivity. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

In this procedure, subjects are tachistoscopically presented photographs of human faces showing emotional expressions, and are asked to indicate whether the emotion was pleasant or unpleasant after each trial. A subject's emotion perception threshold is the minimum exposure duration required for better than chance performance. This threshold measure was stable (r = .80) over 2 weeks. Moreover, thresholds were significantly related to the Thinking-Feeling scale of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and to a measure of empathy, in the predicted directions. Thresholds were not related to current mood states, self-esteem, or thresholds for a nonemotional face judgment task. Buck's (1991) developmental-interactionist theory of emotional information processing, which distinguishes between knowledge-by-acquaintance and knowledge-by-description, is used as a framework for conceptualizing this threshold technique. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

The consistency vs self-enhancement debate led us to look for ways in which artists differing in self-esteem would be differentially positive about their own work relative to other artists' work. Instead, we found that the artists who were especially positive about their own work during the conversations (those low in self-esteem, LSEs) were also especially positive about the other artists' work. Self-enhancement seemed less important to the LSEs than the goals of seeming pleasant and likable. Because we let the artists speak for themselves rather than limiting their responses to rating scales we had designed, we were also able to learn about their conversational ways of dealing with criticism and praise. We found, for example, that when their partners offered positive evaluations, LSEs were especially likely to express agreement. When LSEs did say something negative during the discussions, they stated the criticism as just their opinion, rather than a fact. High self-esteem artists, who seemed to be trying to appear competent by being critical, did just the opposite. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Ehrlich's (1973) principle of self-congruity and the principle of downward social comparison proposed by Wills (1981) were examined. In the first study, self-esteem was positively associated with prejudice among majority subjects, whereas among minority subjects a negative relation was found. Additionally, positive ingroup evaluation in combination with prejudice appeared among majority youth, whereas among minority youth ingroup evaluation and prejudice were correlated negatively. These results for the majority subjects are most in agreement with downward social comparison theory. In contrast, the results for the minority subjects are more in agreement with self-congruity theory. These findings were replicated in a second study where self-esteem was measured as a consequence of group evaluations. The results show that the relationship between self-esteem and prejudice is affected by existing social relations and group status. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Using both individual values items and value composites (ratings and rankings), replicable correlates were identified. Among the 36 values, openness had nine replicable correlates, most notably the terminal value of world of beauty and the instrumental value imaginative. Openness also was reliably related to the positive valuing of being broadminded as well as negative valuing of social recognition, salvation, being clean, obedient, responsible, and self-controlled. Moreover, openness correlated positively in all three samples with the maturity and self-direction values composites, and negatively with the achievement and restrictive conformity composites. Results suggest that, more than the other dimensions of personality, openness to experience best accounts for what people value in their lives. The results also imply that people value qualities that they already possess. We conclude with a discussion of how traits and values relate more broadly and with speculations on the possible origins of openness. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

Results indicated that erotophilics have stronger associations between positive and sexual words, whereas erotophobics have stronger associations between negative and sexual words.

For example, people who say they would keep a lost wallet ascribe less blame to a target who does the same than do people who say they would return the wallet. The relative preference effect does not require that people consider their ethical choices to be morally superior to the alternatives: The effect occurs even when people who endorse less ethically desirable alternatives (such as keeping a lost wallet) admit that the opposite alternative (such as returning the wallet) is more admirable or desirable, and also when they admit that they would teach their children to do the opposite. The two studies in this paper examined different explanations for the pervasiveness of the relative preference effect. Study 1 assessed the possibility that people evaluate targets who agree with them more favorably because they assume the targets' decisions will produce positive outcomes. Study 1 provided evidence against this interpretation by showing that the relative preference effect occurred when the target's decision produced negative as well as positive outcomes. Study 2 assessed the possibility that people evaluate agreeing others more favorably because they assume most people share their ethical preferences. This explanation was supported by a significant interaction between consensus information and agreement-disagreement information on blame attributions: The relative preference effect occurred when participants were provided with information indicating most of their peers agreed with their ethical decision, but not when they believed a majority of their peers disagreed. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

In particular, self-criticism emerged as interpersonally complex, incorporating distrust, social avoidance, as well as concern with others' reactions. However, comprehensive analyses revealed that similarities between the two constructs outweighed the differences.

Furthermore, not all JPI variables found a place in the Big Five factor space.

This indicates that repressors have relatively poor memory for negative emotional experiences but relatively good memory for positive emotional experiences. Subjects were then given a surprise memory test for the words used to elicit the recall of these experiences. Repressors (relative to nonrepressors) recalled a significantly smaller proportion of negative words that had not elicited the recall of an experience.

Experiments 5 and 6 use self-report data to demonstrate that scale scores predict the extent to which people spend time by themselves and with others. Experiment 7 uses scale scores to predict the amount of social interaction in a laboratory setting. Experiment 8 demonstrates that scale scores can predict the amount of time people spend alone beyond that predicted by introversion-extraversion.

  abstract = {Tellegen and Walker (in press) have argued that highly evaluative adjectives provide significant information about personality and should not be excluded from trait taxonomic studies. Their analyses have identified two evaluative dimensions labeled Positive Valence (PV) and Negative Valence (NV). This study examines the meaning of these evaluative dimensions from the perspective of the five-factor model. Participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (N = 412) completed Tellegen, Grove, and Waller's (1991) Inventory of Personal Characteristics 7; self-reports and spouse and peer ratings on the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) were also available. PV and NV were not related to measures of response bias and did not moderate self/observer agreement. Joint factor analysis showed that in a five-factor solution, PV and NV had substantial communality and defined several factors. Correlations with NEO-PI-R facet scales suggested that PV and NV are associated with substantive aspects of personality, with PV related especially to Assertiveness and low Modesty, and NV related to Depression and low Competence. Although PV and NV are not fundamental factors in the description of personality, they are potentially important in understanding self-appraisals and social evaluations. © 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Two studies that examined the correlates of peoples' reports of their own psychological well-being are reported (Ryff, 1989). In Study 1, extraverts reported better psychological adjustment than introverts, especially when they completed the questionnaires with no one else present. Need for social approval and the sex of the participant were unrelated to self-reports of well-being. Satisfaction with social activities, especially activities involving friends and parents, predicted psychological well-being but the frequency of social activity did not. Completing questionnaires in the presence of friends led to better self-assessments of well-being than completing them in the presence of strangers. In Study 2, internal locus of control, high desire for control, and being female, as well as perceived control over the testing situation, were found to predict reports of better psychological adjustment. It is suggested that future research on self-assessments of psychological well-being focus on: (a) the interaction effects of personality and situational variables; (b) the difference between seeking social interaction and seeking social approval: (c) the distinction between platonic and romande relationships, and; (d) changes in the correlates of psychological well-being throughout the life-cycle. © 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

In addition, it was hypothesized that the NPI would be associated with antagonism and hostility, characteristics that should contribute to narcissists' frequently observed interpersonal difficulties. As expected, the NPI was associated with extremely positive self-images as well as low self-complexity (Study 1). High NPI scores were also associated with a self-aggrandizing attributional style (Study 1) and higher scores on hostility and antagonism (Study 2). High NPI scorers appeared to benefit the most from the perception of available social support during periods of high stress.

An experiment examined the influence of positive feedback, couched in the language of power imagery, on creativity and self-affect in college males who were both high and low in power motivation. Power motivation was determined by the Thematic Apperception Test, creativity by the Remote Associates Test, and self-affect by the Reactions Inventory.

Subjects completed the Reactions Inventory and the Remote Associates Test subsequent to these experimental manipulations. Subjects high in power motivation who received positive feedback scored the highest in creativity and self-affect. In accordance with a theory that Isen, Daubman and Nowicki (1987) put forth that links creativity with heightened affect, increase in self-affect by high-need-for-power persons in response to positive feedback is posited as the mechanism that accounts for why high-need-for-power persons may show a proclivity toward creativity. © 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {In an attempt to explain the continuing shortage of organ donors, we began by exploring the linkage between the signing of organ donation forms and behaviors which involves death, e.g., visiting friends with terminal illnesses, attending funerals of acquaintances, etc. In general, we found some evidence that persons who would resist signing forms allowing for organ donation also seem averse to participating in situations that are death-related, and seem unwilling to think and talk about morality-related issues. Subsequently, using the signing of organ donation cards as an indication of the way individuals respond to thoughts about mortality, we hypothesized that donation card signing would be associated with authoritarianism and perspective-taking humor. Authoritarianism was assumed to be a negative correlate of donation card signing, since highly authoritarian individuals are less likely to be altruistic to strangers and more likely to become anxious and fearful when thinking about mortality. Perspective-taking humor, on the other hand, involves being able to distance oneself from the emotional consequences of aversive experiences. Therefore, it was expected to allow for thinking about death with less fear and to be positively associated with donor card signing. The data supported the hypotheses linking authoritarianism, humor, and donation card signing. Subjects who were highly authoritarian and low in perspective-taking humor were the least likely to have signed their organ donation forms. This was reflected in main effects and a significant interaction between the two predictors. Humorless authoritarians were the most likely to have left blank the organ donation forms attached to their driver's licenses. © 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Three surveys of American undergraduate students explore a central aspect of the concept of “physical self:” the vulnerability or sensitivity of different parts of the body surface, especially apertures, to intrusion and contamination. The basic measure used was rated displeasure at imagined contact of various body parts of the subject with plain neutral objects (e.g., a Q-tip or a poker chip) or with that same object after imagined contact with a potentially offensive site (e.g., a stranger′s mouth). All contaminated objects were described as sterilized by dry heat before contact with the subject. The principal findings from these studies are: (1) Contact with apertures is more unpleasant than contact with unbroken skin. (2) Displeasure at contact with apertures can be analyzed into two components: intrusion sensitivity and contamination sensitivity. (3) The anus is the aperture that is most intrusion sensitive, while the mouth and vagina are the most contamination sensitive points on the body. (4) In general, the more susceptible an aperture to contamination, the more potent it is as a contaminant for other persons. (5) Within the mouth, the sense of offensiveness of an intruding object increases with both physical contact (especially of the tongue) and the sense of “inclusion,” that is, being within the mouth cavity even in the absence of contact. (6) Heterosexual males display strong negativity to any sort of contact with other males, while they seem to sexualize contact with unknown females. For heterosexual females and homosexual males, the pattern of sensitivity (by aperture) to cockroaches is like that to strange males or females. However, for heterosexual males, strange male contact is like cockroach contact, but strange female contact is not. © 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

Children were selected on the basis of high, medium, or low negative emotionality scores derived through factor analysis of items on relevant dimensions of three temperament measures (DOTS-R, MCTQ, and EAS). Self-regulation was assessed with stories told to Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) stimuli. A measure of distractibility was also included. Multiple regression analysis indicated that higher negative emotionality was associated with lower self-regulation scores after removal of the variance associated with Age, Gender, and Race. Distractibility made a unique contribution at the last step indicating that higher distractibility was associated with lower self-regulation. © 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {The most important discrepancy between Gray′s (1981) and Newman′s (1987) approaches to passive avoidance was based on the role played by the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS): Gray, but not Newman, predicted that passive avoidance deficits could be mediated by an underactive BIS and hence that these deficits could be found in strictly aversive contexts. Two different studies have been conducted to investigate these issues. In the first, two versions (one involving reward and punishment and the second punishment only) of the successive go/no go discrimination task used by Newman, Widom, and Nathan (1985) were administrated to groups classified according to extraversion and neuroticism. Results, in accordance with Newman′s hypotheses, showed more passive avoidance and less omission errors in (neurotic) extraverts as compared to (stable) introverts in mixed incentive contexts. In addition, consistent with Gray′s model, more passive avoidance and less omission errors were also found in stable extraverts as compared to neurotic introverts in solely aversive contexts. In Study 2, multiple choice exams were used considering each question an approach-avoidance conflict (similar in some aspects to the reward-punishment task in Study 1). Once effects of knowledge were controlled, extraverts had a greater tendency to approach than introverts in these exams. Finally, a third study confirmed that passive avoidance errors both in the reward-and-punishment task of Study 1 and in multiple choice were correlated. Different mechanisms leading to disinhibition in extraverts that are dependent on the functioning of both the BIS and Behavioral Activation System (BAS) and the contribution of sensitivity to unconditioned and conditioned stimuli are discussed. © 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

Based on exploratory principal components analysis, confirmatory analysis unveiled an oblique four-factor model (Positive Affectivity, Negative Intensity, Serenity, Negative Reactivity) that achieved only mediocre goodness of fit. Further attempts to find a better fitting model were futile. The common practice of scoring the AIM using the one-factor model emphasizes known external validity over conceptual clarity; future use of the four-factor model, for which external validity is unknown, would emphasize conceptual precision.

Personality indices included the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ), the Socialization (So) Scale of the California Psychological Inventory, and the Activity Preference Questionnaire (APQ), a measure of fearfulness. RRI total scores were correlated positively with measures of MPQ Constraint, the APQ, and the So scale, and negatively with measures of MPQ Negative Emotionality and the presence of parole violations. In almost no cases were the above relations significantly affected by social desirability. In addition, the two major RRI subscales, Punitiveness and Attitudes, exhibited differential patterns of relations with several personality measures. Finally, the RRI did not exhibit incremental validity relative to personality indices in the postdiction of parole violations. These findings help to clarify the meaning of RRI scores and provide strong support for the claim that honesty tests are not independent of personality variables. © 1994 Academic Press.

Multiple discriminant analysis revealed three distinct body build stereotypes represented by two statistically significant functions. Data supported an unfavorable perception of the chubby body build stereotype and a favorable perception of the average body build. The thin stereotype emerged as a combination of the socially desirable traits identified with the average build stereotype and the negative physical capability traits associated with the chubby build stereotype. Subsequent gender by grade by stereotype analyses of variance showed gender differences for the thin body stereotype, revealing a more positive view of the socially desirable traits of the thin stereotype by girls than by boys. Follow-up contrasts and trend analyses by grade indicated that the thin stereotype remains constant across age while the unfavorable perception of the chubby stereotype appears between first and second grade.

Dyadic interactions of HDMs and LDMs were examined and results showed that as predicted, LDMs, as compared to HDMs, used more affect-externalizing than affect-containing defenses. This effect was qualified by the sex composition of the dyad such that LDMs used more externalizing defenses than HDMs in same-sex, but not in mixed-sex, dyads. © 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

Measures taken immediately prior to the performance period indicated that systolic blood pressure reactivity (a) was greater in the High Demand condition than in the Low and Very High Demand conditions for those with low reported ability, but (b) tended to increase with the level of task demand for those with high reported ability. Moreover, whereas systolic responsiveness tended to be greater for Low Ability subjects than for High Ability subjects when task demand was low and was greater for Low Ability subjects than for High Ability subjects when task demand was high, it tended to be greater for High Ability subjects than for Low Ability subjects when task demand was very high.

  abstract = {We propose that the relationship between shyness and depression is mediated by a negative attributional style. To test this, we compared attributional style and level of depression for shy versus non-shy college students. We also examined the relationship between shyness and depression with attributional style held constant. In support of our conceptualization, shy students were more depressed and had a more negative attributional style than non-shy students. Further, as predicted by the mediation hypothesis, there was no difference between the shy and non-shy groups in depression when the effect of attributional style was removed. We discuss the implications of our findings for future work on cognitive aspects of shyness. © 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Depression and loneliness are two characteristic problems of adolescence. However, beginning in adolescence, girls experience depression at twice the rate of boys. Since depression and loneliness are highly correlated, it is surprising that girls are not also lonelier than boys. In fact, when gender differences do emerge, it is boys, not girls, who tend to be lonelier. We examined two possible explanations for this paradox: (1) a gender-specific response bias, characterized by a denial of emotional distress for boys that differentially affects reports of depression versus loneliness, and (2) gender differences in the relationship between depression and loneliness, whereby depression has a greater association with loneliness for boys than girls. Support was obtained for explanation two. Although there were no gender differences in loneliness among the nondepressed or the highly depressed, mildly depressed boys were significantly lonelier than mildly depressed girls and just as lonely as highly depressed boys. This depression/loneliness distinction for mildly depressed girls may be magnified by the large number of female depressives (65% in this sample) who fall into the mildly depressed range. Girls were also more likely than boys to report turning to their friends when feeling depressed, and results are discussed in terms of coping processes that may subserve the distinction between depression and loneliness. © 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

Results indicated that permissiveness style by mothers or fathers was not significantly related to procrastination scores in their daughters. Authoritarian fathers, however, were significantly likely to raise daughters with decisional (r = .32) and avoidant (r = .31) procrastination tendencies. Authoritative fathers, in contrast, were significantly likely to raise daughters who were nonprocrastinators (decisional r = - .22; avoidant r = - .28). Mother's parental authority style was not significantly related to procrastination scores reported by their daughters, but mothers who are avoidant procrastinators are more likely to raise daughters who are avoidant procrastinators (r = .26) as well. Further, daughters categorized as dysfunctional procrastinators (n = 28) reported greater anger-in suppression perceived their fathers as more authoritarian and less authoritative, and had mothers who claimed to be more indecisive compared to nonprocrastinator daughters (n = 33). It would appear that fathers' parental authority style had a major influence on daughters who develop dysfunctional procrastination tendencies. These female procrastinators expressed anger emotions and had a mother who reported chronic indecision and tended to be an avoidant procrastinator. Future research should investigate other indirect and direct associations of parenting with offspring procrastination tendencies. © 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Recent work suggests that role evaluation variables, such as ratings of role stress, may be better predictors of psychological well-being than the number of roles an individual occupies. Little is yet known, however, about the possible influence of personality factors on these role judgments. Accordingly, the present research examined this issue by assessing the relationship between dysfunctional attitudes (i.e., extremely rigid and negative self-evaluative standards) and ratings of role stress. Initial findings indicated that those individuals endorsing a larger number of dysfunctional attitudes also rated their personal role experiences as more stressful. As a further major goal, the present studies also assessed the relative contributions of both dys functional attitudes and role stress ratings to predictions of various outcome measures of well-being. Study 1 found that higher levels of dysfunctional attitude endorsement and greater role stress ratings were both associated with increased depression and lower self-esteem. The second study, however, indicated that only dysfunctional attitudes were able to predict depression, self-esteem, and positive and negative affect in a longitudinal manner. This pattern for dysfunctional attitudes was especially robust, as these longitudinal predictions remained significant even after accounting for initial levels of well-being. Discussion then focused on the importance of including relevant personality variables in research that attempts to elucidate the relationship between various role assessments and psychological well-being. © 1994 Academic Press, Inc.},

In the present study (and its replication), judges evaluated speaker state anxiety from brief transcripts with and without speech errors. Judges correctly identified the level of state anxiety, and two types of speech errors seemed to be influential (speech disturbances and silent pauses). These same speech errors also occur more frequently in encoding studies of speaker anxiety. The predicted linear relationship for speaker coping style was revealed: repressors were judged as most anxious followed by defensive high trait anxious, high trait anxious, and the true low trait anxious. Predictions for two specific coping style groups showed that repressors were evaluated as more anxious than the true low trait anxious.

These relationships were obtained after controlling for the influence of attachment to parents, peer social support, and gender on identity development.

This pattern suggests that pessimists do not lack high hopes or aspirations for themselves, but that the hopes seem not to be translated into expectations.

The conversations were transcribed and 10 verbal behaviors were scored from the transcripts. Observers read the transcripts and rated each of the original participants on the same eight dispositions. Encoding, analyzed conservatively, tended to be weaker than decoding but did account for up to 20 % of the variance in self-reported dispositions. Ten matched links were associated with self-other agreement correlations for extraversion and aloofness.

The results of regression analyses between the 16PF and the BF indicated that authoritarianism was related to three second-order factors: Behavior Control, Tough Poise, and low Independence, but was more strongly related to seven first-order factors: low Imagination, Concrete Thought, Insensitivity, Closed-mindedness, Self-discipline, Seriousness, and Suspiciousness. In Part 2, a subsample of 139 students also completed the Altemeyer Right-Wing Authoritarianism Scale (RWA) and Ray Directiveness Scale (RDS). It was found that the RWA paralleled the BF in terms of the 16PF factors associated with it, while the RDS was dissimilar from the other two scales in this respect. The RDS was primarily related to the Dominance and Social Boldness first-order factors and the Independence second-order factor. First- and second-order conversion equations are reported for the BF, RDS, and RWA.

However, they were not more likely to report unwanted termination of relationships, sexual events, or events experienced by close friends or relatives. Further, dysphoric persons continued to report more negative events even when analyses were restricted to events that were consensually negative. In instances in which persons reported experiencing the same type of event, more dysphoric persons were not more likely to rate these events as negative. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dysphoric persons are at greater risk for the actual occurrence of negative events. Nonetheless, the relation between negative events and increases in dysphoria remained when initial symptoms were controlled statistically. There was some evidence that dysphoric persons were more likely to experience worsening of symptoms in response to negative and neutral events, as well as improvement of symptoms following positive events. However, these results were not robust across samples.

  abstract = {Using data provided by male university students, several structural equation models were developed and tested to assess the interrelationship of pornography use, anti-women attitudes, and propensity for sexual violence. The model best fitting the data is one in which use of Sexually Violent Pornography and Anti-Women Attitudes are exogenous latent variables predicting self-reported Likelihood of Rape and Likelihood of using Sexual Force, as well as self-reported history of having achieved sexual intercourse by use of Coercion and Force. A variation of this model which includes use of Nonviolent Pornography as an exogenous variable was also tested. Consistent with previous research, use of nonviolent pornography was not uniquely associated with potential or actual sexual aggression. The findings suggest the potential roles of both attitudes and sexually violent pornography in the occurrence of sexual aggression. Further, they support other research findings that suggest it is not merely exposure to sexually explicit materials, per se, but the combination of sex and violence in pornographic materials that encourages or facilitates sexual aggression. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {Two studies examined the relations between self-monitoring and motivations for forming and maintaining romantic relationships. Investigation 1 revealed that high and low self-monitoring individuals have contrasting motivations that influence what they look for in, and seek to obtain from, romantic partners. Specifically, high self-monitors reported greater extrinsic motives for maintaining a relationship than did low self-monitors, and low self-monitors reported greater intrinsic motives than did high self-monitors. Investigation 2 revealed that these differences in motivations between high and low self-monitors are reflected in their differential preferences for characteristics in a dating partner. Overall, the results suggest that self-monitoring may influence whether and why individuals enter long-term relationships and what they seek to obtain from these relationships. © 1993 Academic Press.

Utilizing 143 pairs of undergraduate female participants, the present study explored subjects' abilities to gain and maintain control in an interpersonal context. Interpersonal control was operationalized as successful persuasion in a two-person discussion task, wherein one participant had hidden instructions to be maximally persuasive in discussing a questionnaire about social behavior. The results indicated that less successful persuasion was associated with increases in depressed mood. Furthermore, women with high masculinity and low femininity were able to gain interpersonal control regardless of the sex role of their partner. The results also suggested that high femininity is associated both with giving up control in interpersonal tasks and with increases in depressed mood when one is faced with the task of exerting interpersonal control. The findings were interpreted in terms of the importance of sex role characteristics in learned helplessness and depression. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.},

Confirmatory factor analysis using LISREL 7 demonstrated that the intended factoral model of the SS provided an inadequate fit with the data. A reliable short form of the SS was proposed that provides a better fit between a three-factor model and the data. Men scored higher than did women on the sexual-esteem and sexual-preoccupation scales of both the original SS and the newly created short form. Both the SS and the short form were only moderately correlated with measures of global self-esteem and clinical depression.

Experiment 2 tested a cognitive explanation of field-dependence-independence differences in hindsight bias based on the phenomenon of output interference: the generation of supporting reasons interferes with the generation of contradictory reasons. It was found that field-dependents were much more susceptible than field-independents to output interference in generating reasons, and this was also reflected in their likelihood judgments. Field-dependents were also much more affected than field-independents by the presence of outcome feedback in both their generation of contradictory reasons and their likelihood judgments.

Across four data sets, between-goal correlations and partial correlations tended to support Maslow′s proposition with “intention” ratings but not with the traditionally-used “importance” ratings. Smaller differences in scale wording also affected outcomes. Negative reactions to nonattainment were relatively larger for goals related to lower needs in Maslow′s hierarchy; positive reactions to attainment were larger at higher levels.

In the second study, a combination of anxiety level and defensiveness level were used to identify four distinct groups, including repressors. Results indicated that repressors engaged in less defensive attribution than either high-anxious or defensive high-anxious individuals; however, repressors did not differ from low-anxious individuals in this regard. Thus, characteristically coping with threatening stimuli through a repressive coping strategy appears to mediate the need to engage in defensive attribution of responsibility in a manner consistent with an arousal-based motivational bias. © 1992.},

The performance of the high anxiety subjects decreased in the stressful condition. However, the high anxiety subjects performed better than the low anxiety subjects in the nonstressful condition. These data provide direct evidence for changes in working memory capacity resulting from the joint effects of trait anxiety and situational stress. © 1992.},

  abstract = {College students (204 women, 103 men) completed a set of inventories on procrastination, perfectionism, self-presentation, self-awareness, and self-handicapping. Separate exploratory factor analyses with oblique (promax) rotations were performed for procrastinators (n = 168) and nonprocrastinators (n = 139), yielding two-factor solutions. For procrastinators, Factor 1 loadings were social anxiety, acquisitive and protective self-presentations, perfectionism, and self-handicapping, while Factor 2 loadings included private and public self-consciousness. For nonprocrastinators, Factor 1 loadings were public and private self-consciousness, self-handicapping, and social anxiety, and Factor 2 contained acquisitive self-presentation and perfectionism. Results suggest that perfect behavior for procrastinators may be a strategic act of self-presentation aimed at "getting along" with others, but for nonprocrastinators it is a striving for excellance motivated by "getting ahead" of others. © 1992.},

A two-factor solution was reported for measures of behavioral and emotional control, with measures of defensiveness loading on the same factor as a number of measures of constraint and self-control. In a second analysis, including measures of ruminative thinking, three factors emerged pertaining to behavioral and emotional control and rumination. Behavioral inhibition correlated negatively with rumination but was uncorrelated with emotional inhibition. Emotional inhibition and rumination were positively correlated.

In hierarchical regression analyses, peer influence, shyness, and alcohol expectancies made significant contributions to predicting alcohol use, but the shyness by alcohol expectancy interaction did not increase prediction of drinking. Also, it was found that alcohol expectancies operated as a suppressor variable. Although the simple correlation between shyness and alcohol use was near zero, inclusion of expectancies in the regression removed irrelevant variance in shyness leading to a significant, inverse relation between shyness and drinking. Results are discussed relative to how shyness problems may relate to minimal drinking activity and how alcohol expectancy findings are consistent with recent tests of the alcohol expectancy model. © 1992.},

In the present study, data from a national probability sample in the United States were used to explore whether extraverts report higher levles of subjective well-being regardless of the social versus nonsocial nature of their environments. At two points in time separated by 10 years it was found that extraverts were happier whether living alone or with others (p's ≤ .001), whether living in large cities or rural areas (p's ≤ .001), and whether working in social or nonsocial occupations (p ≤ .07 and p < .05). Extraverts were also happier across racial, gender, and age groups. The data did not support the idea that extraverts' greater happiness is only due to the greater amount of time they spend in social environments. The findings did not support a personality-situation matching explanation of subjective well-being and indicate that extraverts tend to be happier on the average regardless of their level of social contact. It was also found that extraverts work in social occupations significantly more often (p ≤ .001) and live in households with more persons significantly more often (p ≤ .05), but do not live in greater proportions in large cities as compared to rural areas. Thus, extraverts do appear to select themselves into certain long-term life situations. © 1992.},

Two further studies provided convergent and discriminant validity for the four belief factors: The belief factors were not correlated with relationship satisfaction or social desirability, but were generally related in the predicted fashion to relationship attachment dimensions, love attitudes, and the self-reported frequencies of close relationship behaviors. As expected, the final study found evidence that the relationship beliefs moderated the relations between self-reports of belief-related behaviors in close relationships and relationship satisfaction.

Further, scale scores were independent of the response latencies for processing scale irrelevant items. Study 2 was based on a measure of 20 normal personality traits. First, response latencies showed at least modest test-retest stability for a 1-week interval. Second, the pattern of positive and negative correlations between latencies and scale scores emerged even more strongly than in Study 1.

Family problems (childhood and adulthood) were more frequently reported for mothers and fathers described as being cold or inconsistent than those described as warm. Avoidant adult romantic attachment style was associated with cold parenting styles, family problems, and lower social, but not performance, self-esteem, compared to those reporting the secure style.

Participants shadowed the material presented to the attended ear and simultaneously responded to a probe task presented on a video monitor. Results revealed that repressors made significantly fewer shadowing errors than high anxious and defensive-high anxious participants and marginally significantly fewer shadowing errors than low anxious participants for both neutral and negative words. High anxious participants, however, were later able to recognize the negative words that had been presented to the unattended ear at well above chance levels, whereas the recognition memory of repressors for such negative unattended words was at chance levels. In addition, repressors' responses to a postexperiment questionnaire indicated a significantly greater number of distracting thoughts during the experiment relative to other participants. Repressors, it seems, are indeed skillful at avoidant information processing and this capacity may well be related to the emotional memory deficits they have displayed in previous research. © 1991.},

Cross-species comparisons suggested problems with the r K selection construct, and indicated that sexuality was not inversely related to intelligence. Analyses of 1960-1985 U.S. fertility data revealed that differences in black versus white birth rates were strongly associated with differences in infant mortality rates. As black infant mortality rates declined, black birth rates also declined at rates parallel to that of whites. Such findings suggest that the sexual behavior of blacks and whites may be equally responsive to their ecologies, rather than a function of genetic differences in K-selection reproductive strategies. © 1991.},

Immediately prior to task performance, subjects were asked to indicate how much effort they intended to exert, how energetic they felt, and how unpleasant it would be to have to stay and perform the second experimental task. Subjects with high scores on an inventory of self-esteem had relatively low effort and energy ratings when the task was described as easy and relatively high effort and energy ratings when the task was described as difficult. In contrast, subjects with low scores on the self-esteem inventory had relatively high effort and energy ratings when the task was described as easy and showed a drop in effort and no change in energy when the task was described as difficult. Unpleasantness ratings tended to track the effort and energy ratings. Results are discussed in terms of Brehm's recent theory of motivation and reasoning concerning the role perceptions of ability may play in determing estimates of instrumental task difficulty. © 1991.},

The present study tested the proposition that a heightened need for a determinist view of the environment is a generalized response to stress. Accordingly, stress was hypothesized to strengthen the tendency of individuals to apply causal explanations to events of any kind, including events that do not directly affect them or are unrelated to their condition. This general hypothesis was confirmed by the results of three experiments. Explanations of these results in terms of information processing models and of the need to maintain control in the face of adversity were discussed. © 1991.},

  abstract = {Certain experimental results appear at odds with traditional characterizations of anxious individuals. Specifically, anxious subjects have been observed to behave in ways that might best be characterized as impulsive. To account for these data, we propose a general model of impulsive behavior that is primarily a synthesis of the theoretical perspectives of Gray (1987b) and Eysenck (1967). The neuroticism construct, which we conceive as reflecting the lability or reactivity of Gray's nonspecific arousal system (NAS), plays a pivotal role in this synthesis. We suggest that neuroticism is a predisposition to experience heightened NAS activity, and describe three processes through which heightened NAS activity impairs response modulation, thus engendering impulsive behavior. The proposed model highlights a fundamental similarity between anxiety and impulsivity. Furthermore, our formulation may prove useful for resolving inconsistent laboratory findings related to impulsivity, as well as for explaining the maladaptive behavior displayed by anxious and impulsive individuals. © 1991.},

The one area is constituted by the issue of the individual's consistency in responding to a trait-list; the second area is the realm of consistency theory, in which the primary interest has been the individual's establishing consistency with respect to a small number of cognitive elements-normally two. The starting point of the present studies is the premise that uncertainty in a behavioral realm instigates an orientation toward consistency; in short, uncertainty within a situation can serve as a starting point for the individual's attempting to view aspects of the situation-target persons included-as more internally consistent. The first study shows that uncertainty in a performance realm (art) relates to a relative preference for a trait-characterization of the artist that is internally consistent. The subsequent six studies (Studies 2-7) all involve the subjects' rating a particular target person, or target organization, by means of trait-lists. The six studies combined indicate that lowered or threatened certainty results in a more consistent responding to the traint-list in question. Further, in accord with findings from consistency theory, these effects are observed primarily at the very beginning of the trait lists. © 1991.},

When the damage was unexpected or could not be corrected, level of anger was sometimes elevated as well. It is concluded that human anger is affected by three basic aspects of a harmful event, its main determinants being extent of damage and, to a lesser degree, the causes of the damaging act and the likelihood of damage occurrence.

Type A (N = 79) and B (N = 109) college undergraduates completed a questionnaire assessing the frequency, content, style, and consequences of their reminiscence about positive past experiences. Findings supported two hypotheses: relative to Type Bs, Type As were less likely to report that they consciously look back on positive events after these events are over in order to store details for later recall, and were more likely to report that they typically reminisce about past achievements. Contradicting Friedman and Ulmer's observations, however, there were no significant A B differences in the reported frequency, style, or consequences of recalling positive memories. The findings are discussed in terms of components of Type A behavior, such as competitive achievement-striving and self-esteem enhancement, that may make Type As (a) less likely to store, but not to recall, positive memories and (b) particularly likely to reminisce about personal accomplishments. Plausible reasons for the relative lack of support for Friedman and Ulmer's hypotheses are discussed in the context of directions for future research. © 1991.},

  abstract = {Antonovsky (1987) has proposed that the Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale assesses a personality-related "stress-resistance resource" that comprises the belief that life is comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful. To date, most of the research on the SOC scale has been conducted in Israel. One finding that appears to be particularly robust, at least among Israeli adolescents, is an inverse association between SOC total scale scores and trait anxiety. The first purpose of the present study, which examines American college students, is to attempt to provide some external validity evidence for the Israeli research linking SOC and anxiety. The present study also attempts to refine previous research by examining whether anxiety is differentially related to the comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness SOC subscales. In addition, this study seeks to extend previous research by examining whether individuals scoring high on SOC would perceive social support to be more readily available than individuals scoring low on SOC. Finally, the present investigation provides preliminary reliability and validity data for the short form version of the SOC scale. Results showed that SOC total scores were strongly negatively correlated with levels of trait anxiety. The relative strength of the correlations of anxiety to the various SOC subscales could not be assessed accurately because the SOC subscales were unreliable. Other results showed SOC scores were unrelated to the perceived availability of four different types of social support. These data support the generalizability of Israeli research suggesting that individuals scoring high on SOC enjoy better mental health than their lower scoring counterparts. In addition, results showing that SOC is independent of socially based stress-resistance resources suggest the SOC scale has discriminant validity. Finally, the present results support the validity of the shortened version of the SOC scale, but suggest that use of short form subscale scores may be problematic. © 1991.},

  abstract = {Individuals with an internal locus of control have been found to be more socially successful than those with an external orientation. In the present study, the possibility was tested that a significant contributor to the internals' social success was their ability to discriminate nonverbal information in the form of facial expressions more quickly than externals. Forty-two females were asked to discriminate which of a series of two facial expressions and which of a series of two words were similar, and which were different. Word discrimination performance was used to evaluate whether speed of discrimination differences between internals and externals was specific to facial expressions or to a more generalized ability to discriminate all information more quickly. As predicted, internals, compared to externals, were significantly faster discriminators of facial expressions but not of words. The results were discussed within an interpersonal communication perspective. © 1990.},

Personal ethical philosophies also influenced moral choices and post-transgression reactions, for more of the idealistic subjects chose to act immorally relative to the low idealists (91.66% vs 70.83%), and subjects who were low in both idealism and relativism were less likely to transgress a moral norm if they personally would benefit.

Experiment 2 used low as well as high hypnotizables and administered hypnotic or nonhypnotic analgesia instructions and compliance instructions to the same subjects on separate pain trials. Reported pain reductions produced by hypnotic and nonhypnotic analgesia suggestions and those produced by compliance instructions were substantially and significantly correlated. Furthermore, hypnotizability correlated with compliance-induced reported pain reductions as highly as it correlated with the reported reductions produced by hypnotic analgesia suggestions. Among high hypnotizables (but not low hypnotizables) compliant responding was predicted by social desirability.

Voluntary organizations are identified as natural settings that enable individuals to develop a sense of psychological empowerment. Empowerment was measured by cognitive, personality, and motivational measures of perceived control. Structural equation modeling was used to compare models for a sample of students and a sample of nonstudent community residents. The model which supports the theory of learned hopefulness included a direct effect of participation in voluntary organizations on psychological empowerment. An alternative model omitted the path between participation and empowerment. The learned hopefulness model reproduced the observed data with less error than the alternative model.

  abstract = {Previous research has indicated that greater knowledge about rape is not associated with reduced rape propensity. The present study differed from previous research by defining rape knowledge as knowledge about the effect of rape on the victim. Two scales were created, one measuring knowledge of rape trauma syndrome and one measuring beliefs about the aversiveness of the rape victim's experience. These scales and measures of attitudes toward rape and self-report likelihood of raping were included in questionnaires completed by 276 male and female undergraduates. Greater knowledge about rape trauma and perception of rape as more aversive were associated with fewer pro-rape attitudes and lower self-report likelihood of raping. The practical implication is that educational interventions may be effective in decreasing the incidence of rape. Theoretical implications are also considered. Specifically, the distinction between hostile and instrumental aggression frequently made in the more general aggression literature is applied to the issue of rape motivation. The pattern of results suggests that rape is more likely to be an act of instrumental aggression than an act motivated by hostility toward women. © 1990.},

On the other hand, subjects who customarily tend to attribute successful outcomes to external factors evidenced higher levels of intrinsic motivation and greater gains in interest-enjoyment after receiving mastery-focused than social comparison praise. A parallel set of effects were found for performance attributions: Internals made more internal attribution (i.e., ability and effort) after receiving social comparison than mastery praise, whereas externals showed the reverse pattern. © 1990.},

Data were collected on T-Anger and, for comparison sake, trait anxiety (T-Anxiety), along with a host of demographic and epidemiological indices. T-Anger correlated significantly with sex, age, and ethnicity. Specifically, females, Eastern respondents, and older persons scored higher on T-Anger compared to their male, Western, and younger counterparts, respectively. Furthermore, T-Anger means were found to decrease linearly as a function of age. T-Anger correlated significantly, though modestly, with a number of self-report health indices, including self-reports of headaches, shortness of breath, wheezing, bronchial problems, and recent hospitalization. A comparison of the effects of background correlates on T-Anger and T-Anxiety indicates that T-Anger is somewhat less sensitive to the effects of background and health variables than T-Anxiety. © 1990.},

In this article, we suggest that there is both a stable and an unstable component of self-evaluations. We propose that the stable component is reflected in one's TYPICAL self-appraisals and that the unstable component is reflected in one's CURRENT self-appraisals. We reasoned that typical appraisals would change little, if at all, following an evaluative event, whereas current appraisals would show substantial change. To test this hypothesis, we had subjects rate themselves along specific dimensions based on how they would evaluate themselves right now and how they would typically evaluate themselves. These ratings were made both before and after subjects received positive, negative, or no evaluative feedback. The results indicated that current self-appraisals declined substantially following negative feedback and became more positive following either positive or no evaluative feedback. Typical appraisals were much more resistant to change, although they did show an overall pattern of change similar to current appraisals. The relationship of self-appraisal change to emotional reactions was also assessed. Correlational analyses revealed that the magnitude of change in current, but not typical appraisals, was strongly related to emotional reactions. This was particularly true following negative feedback. Theoretical implications are discussed. © 1990.},

Previous tests of this hypothesis have yielded mixed results, possibly due to various methodological variations and limitations. Prior studies have typically recorded from only one side of the body, have often used relatively small sample sizes, have frequently employed median split designs, and have almost exclusively used a criterion habituation procedure. The present study recorded electrodermal activity bilaterally and intercompared regression and criterion measures of habituation, using a large sample representing the extremes of the extraversion dimension. Initial response amplitude data showed a pattern of differential lateral asymmetry that was an interactive function of sex and extraversion (p < .05). The regression measure of habituation rate, involving a regression coefficient corrected for the influence of the intercept, showed more rapid habituation in extraverts than in introverts (p < .05) and more rapid habituation in males than in females (p < .05). The criterion measure yielded no differences. Since results that were significant reached only the .05 level of reliability, replication is needed. In addition, present results suggest the need for studies that would examine the differential effects in introverts and extraverts of arousal induced by systematically varied intensities of stimulation. © 1990.},

A theory by McClelland and much prior research evidence suggest that power motivation may be implicated in creativity. There were three conditions to the experiment. The first provided subjects with positive feedback on their attempts at solving an engineering problem, indicating that the solution they rendered impressed the experimenter and likely would impress members of the engineering and scientific community. The second condition resulted in negative feedback from the experimenter and suggested that subjects had failed to create a favorable impact through the solution they proposed. The third condition was a control condition and entailed no feedback to subjects on their performance. Subjects then read and studied a second engineering problem, understanding that they would return and attempt a solution in 2 days. As measured by the Thematic Apperception Test, half the subjects in each condition were high in need for power, and half were low. High-need-for-power subjects both in the positive- and negative-feed-back conditions subsequently showed heightened activation on Thayer's Activation-Deactivation Adjective check list. As contrasted with high-need-for-power subjects in the negative-feedback and control conditions, high-need-for-power subjects in the positive-feedback condition showed high creativity in solutions they proposed to the second engineering problem.

The present studies were designed to test this by examining the effect of unlabelled residual arousal upon appraisals of a potential aversive outcome. In a preliminary investigation, subjects performed a low- or high-effort stair-stepping exercise and then went to a room to rest. Measures of systolic blood pressure and self-perceived arousal taken during the rest period indicated (1) there was residual excitation after 1 and 5 min, but not after 9 min, for high-effort subjects, (2) there was residual excitation after 1 min, but not 5 and 9 min, for low-effort subjects, and (3) although high-effort subjects were still aroused after 5 min, they thought they were near baseline. In the first goal valence study, subjects performed the high-effort exercise and then, 1, 5, or 9 min later, were presented with the opportunity to avoid an aversive reading task by performing successfully a preliminary anagram task. As expected, ratings of how unpleasant the reading task would be were higher at 5 min than at 1 and 9 min. The second goal valence study included low-effort as well as high-effort conditions. Once again, unpleasantness ratings were found to be higher at 5 min than at 1 and 9 min for the high-effort subjects.

In Study 1, a nonexperimental study, we asked subjects for self descriptions, ideal descriptions, and descriptions of a number of liked and not liked peers and used the descriptions to construct indices of self similarity and ideal similarity. We then analyzed the two sorts of similarity as indicators of liking. In particular, we developed measures to assess independently the effects of self similarity and ideal similarity. We found both self and ideal to be indicators of attraction though ideal similarity was a stronger indicator. In addition, we found self-similarity to indicate liking only when self descriptions were close to ideal descriptions. Ideal similarity indicated liking in all cases. In Study 2 we manipulated liking between previously unacquainted female conversation partners and obtained self, ideal, and partner descriptions and constructed similarity indices. The results confirmed those of Study 1. Differences in liking led to larger differences in ideal similarity than in self similarity. Self similarity differences did not appear when self and ideal were different, while ideal similarity differences appeared in all cases. We concluded that the relationship between self similarity and liking is weaker than, and dependent on, the relationship between ideal similarity and liking. We also concluded that when the results of these studies are linked with existing research, the similarity-liking relationship proves to be reciprocal, with similarity predicting liking, accompanying liking, and following liking. Finally we noted that all results are supportive of a consistency interpretation of the relationship between similarity and liking. © 1990.},

Results replicated previous research and indicated that material for which subjects exhibited amnesia on the episodic tasks was generated on the semantic task.

One group of subjects received a modified suggestion which implied that amnesia should extend to other types of memory tasks.

  abstract = {This study reports on the development and early psychometric refinement of the Way of Life Scale (WOLS), a measure of exaggerated social control or "nonmutuality". This construct pertains to a form of control which is thought to be related to the Type A behavior pattern (TABP). Since the TABP has been associated not only with coronary heart disease, but with other functions such as academic performance, vocational success, and a variety of personal/psychological tendencies, an instrument for measuring nonmutuality could prove useful for clinical and research work involving both physical and psychological health. Two samples, one with and one without manifest heart disease, were administered the WOLS along with a battery of measures for assessing the TABP and other forms of control. Results were reliable across groups, suggesting that the WOLS is a reliable and valid means for assessing a unique form of social/interpersonal control. © 1990.},

These behaviors were related to a measure of social influence in a discussion task based on changes from individual to dyadic solutions for the NASA Moon Survival Problem. MANOVA results show that the speaking time per minute and look-speak ratio of moderate men varied significantly with the dominance rank of the partner. Multiple regression indicated that successful interruptions and postural relaxation predicted personality dominance scores, explaining 13.4% of the trait variance.

Personality, life stress, exercise, and hobby questionnaires were administered to 110 male college students. A structured telephone interview was also conducted to assess the reliability of their exercise and hobby self-report information and to further refine the assessment of these variables. Overall, the results support the notion that defensiveness and repression are associated with positive self-presentation styles and with types and amount of time spent in leisure activities. The results support the notion that the MC scale and L scale should not be used interchangeably to assess defensiveness. It is hypothesized that the MC and L scales measure different levels and aspects of defensiveness. Directions for future research are discussed. © 1990.},

Previous studies suggest that women may more favorably evaluate the quality of work attributed to men than women, although differing methodologies and task variables have produced varying results. In this study, women from a college-level Human Sexuality class were requested to judge watercolor slides of illustrations purportedly prepared for textbook consideration. Subjects evaluated the illustrations for technical competence, artist creativity and talent, suitability for a Human Sexuality text, overall quality, and prediction of future success for the artist. Women from each of four developmental levels of feminist identity served as subjects. Results revealed significantly different judgments when illustrations were attributed to a male versus female artist, particularly for women in the early stages of feminist identity development. Women at more advanced developmental positions were less likely to differentially evaluate the merit of the work based on gender. Implications of the findings are discussed. © 1990.},

  abstract = {In each of two studies, subjects were asked to form an impression of a fictional character on the basis of a set of adjectives describing the person and behaviors attributed to the person. The list of behaviors described actions that were either consistent or inconsistent with the set of adjectives, and the ratio of consistent to inconsistent behaviors was varied. In the first study, university and elderly subjects studied the information without distraction. For university students, the behaviors were presented at a 8-s rate, and for the elderly subjects the presentation rate was either 8 or 15 s. In the second study, university students studied the information without distraction or while performing a counting task under the 8-s presentation rate. The extremity of impression ratings in both studies was affected directly by the number of behaviors at both rates of presentation, but was not affected by the favorableness of the behaviors. Recall was affected jointly by the rate of presentation, the proportion of behaviors consistent with the adjectives, and the favorableness of the behaviors. The results were interpreted to support the hypothesis that impression formation and recall of specific behaviors are governed by distinct processing systems. Whereas person memory relies on a resource-based system, impression formation is dependent on the operation of a relatively automatic system. © 1990.},

  abstract = {A number of people who have written from a cognitive perspective have implied that only beliefs perceived as factual influence behavior. By contrast, the Sappington and Russell Four Variable Model proposes that behavior is influenced by beliefs subjectively perceived as non-rational and as not based upon facts (called emotionally based beliefs) as well as by beliefs subjectively perceived as rational and as supported by facts (called intellectually based beliefs). Much prior research supports this proposal. However, the model also proposes that the two types of beliefs derive from different sources and respond to different variables. This has not been previously demonstrated. The present article describes four studies which attempt to demonstrate that intellectually and emotionally based beliefs indeed respond to different variables and can be manipulated independently. Intellectually based, but not emotionally based, beliefs were changed by varying the amount of objective information provided. Emotionally based, but not intellectually based, beliefs were found to be changed by increasing emotional arousal. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 1990.},

Analyses using measures of achievement standards and goals revealed the expected gender differences in the use of intrinsic performance standards and competitive goals. Effects for achievement domain (scholastic, social, personal growth) showed that (a) students reported competitive goals in relation to scholastic accomplishments, whereas social goals characterized accomplishments in the social domain, (b) competitive goals did not characterize accomplishments involving personal growth, and (c) both types of standards (intrinsic and extrinsic) were more heavily endorsed with respect to scholastic and personal growth activities than to social accomplishments.

Subjects rated, via semantic differential scales, two persons whom they had observed (via videotape), working together on several tasks. The relative status of these target persons was manipulated through different introductions to the stimulus tape. The subject's power motive was measured via Winter's (1973, The power motive, New York: Free Press) revised nPower TAT system. Results supported the hypothesis that the effect of men's nPower on the favorability of their evaluations of other people depends upon the target person's status and the evaluative dimension (sociability or competence) employed. More specifically, high nPower men evaluated high status persons as less sociable, and low status persons as less competent, than did men who were not high on nPower. High nPower men tended to evaluate high status persons as more competent than did low nPower men. The status manipulation had a much stronger impact on high nPower men than on men not classified as high on nPower. The latter finding suggests that, in forming their evaluations, high nPower men, like authoritarians, assign great weight to available social labels pertaining to status and prestige and little weight to their own direct impressions of target persons' behavior. © 1989.},

The descriptors that Eysenck provides (and which are commonplace in everyday language) include not only traits, but states as well. This led us to predict that these personality types should evince different patterns and ranges of moods (states) and thus necessitates a crucial test of this ancient typology, specifically in the operationalized form suggested by Eysenck. In a preliminary test of this, Howarth (1988a) demonstrated that expected mood differences among the four types-Melancholic, Sanguine, Phlegmatic, and Choleric-did indeed emerge, suggesting the need for the formulation of the more crucial test over time. In order to test this possibility, 39 representatives of the four groups were selected from a total of 467 persons who had taken the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. They then completed the Howarth Mood-Adjective Checklist (HMACL) over a 10-day period. Their responses were anlyzed using multiple discriminant functions and it was shown that the four types were clearly discriminable in a meaningful manner. Thus, our empirical investigation supports this classical theory of personality as herein defined both on the trait and on the state side. © 1989.},

Two scales of the Personal Orientation Inventory (POI), Time Competence and Inner Directedness, were compared to the overall score on the Hardiness Test as well as three subscales: commitment, control, and challenge. A heterogeneous sample of 42 women completed the two tests anonymously. There was a significant positive relationship between the overall hardiness score and the subscale, challenge, with Time Competence, with challenge contributing most to this relationship. Therefore, it may be concluded that both the Hardiness Test and the POI are measuring some similar aspects of the healthy personality. © 1989.},

Twenty-eight undergraduates, assigned the role of "interviewer," interacted with 89 undergraduates during several 15-min getting acquainted sessions. Interviewers had been led to believe that the subjects they were interviewing were extremely high, average, or extremely low with respect to shyness. Prior to the sessions, all subjects completed a battery of personality measures. Analyses suggested mixed support for an interviewer expectancy effect, with stronger bias effects being found for interviewers given Shy vs Average expectancies than for those given Not Shy vs Average expectancies. Greater bias effects were found for interviewers who scored higher on PRF Achievement, Order, self-rated expressiveness and lower on self-rated shyness. Interviewees who scored higher on Achievement, Dogmatism, Endurance, and Cognitive Structure showed significantly lower bias effects. These findings are interpreted as indicating the importance of the rigidity of cognitive schemas in determing whether or not an expectancy effect will occur. © 1989.},

Erikson (1963) has argued that in order to be generative in adulthood, people must have a fundamental "belief in the species" or a faith that human progress is possible and worth working toward. The present study focuses on hope and trust concerning the self and others (Erikson's "belief in the species"). In addition, however, the study examines the relation between generativity and personality traits, in this case, dominance, leadership, self-absorption, and nurturance. A sample of 70 adults was administered (1) a series of self-report questionnaires converging on Erikson's idea of belief in the species, (2) a self-report scale assessing generativity, (3) measures of personality traits, and (4) two open-ended measures of generativity requiring subjects to describe life commitments and creative endeavors. The results provide modest support for Erikson's claim of a link between belief in the species and generativity, with significant positive correlations obtained (1) between self-report generativity and two measures of belief in species and (2) between generativity assessed through life commitments and one measure of belief in the species. In addition, the personality trait of nurturance was positively related to all three generativity measures. Problems and issues in the assessment of generativity are discussed. © 1989.},

These include morphological characteristics (depth of voice, salient muscularity, buttock size), personality traits (activity level, aggressiveness, cautiousness), social organization (marital stability, mental health, law abidingness), speed of maturation (age to walk alone, age of first breeding, age of death), and sexual variables (gamete production, intercourse frequencies, size of genitalia).

The statements were edited and compiled into a questionnaire, which was rated by 1185 youths. Following a factor analysis, five components of death cognition were extracted. These were (1) Buddhist and Taoist Belief, (2) Just World Belief, (3) Naturalistic Belief, (4) Immortal Soul Belief, and (5) Protestant Belief. Some of these beliefs were associated with age and/or religious orientation of the school attended. In Study 2, another group (N = 1625) of teenagers were sampled from the secondary school population in Hong Kong. Their responses to the questionnaire were again subjected to a factor analysis. Results replicated those of Study 1, and indicated that the componential model of death cognition has much generality. Death cognition was found to be somewhat related to the religious orientation of the school attended and the respondent's gender. Academic achievement also appeared to be a correlate.

Following this reasoning, it was assumed that (a) depressed mood generates angry feelings and hostile inclinations, (b) awareness of one's feelings leads to the regulation of the expression of these feelings and inclinations, and (c) people classified as repressors by the Byrne R-S scale would tend to avoid awareness of their negative affect in comparison to sensitizers. Supporting this argument, it was found that the subjects, university women, expressed the greatest hostility toward a target person when (1) they had been placed in a depressed mood, (2) were identified as repressors, and (3) were required to indicate their opinions of the target quickly and with little thought. At least some of the impulsive hostility displayed by depressives might thus be due to the unpleasantness of their feelings. © 1989.},

  abstract = {A tool assessing position within Maslow's hierarchy of needs is presented. The Maslowian Assessment Survey (MAS) taps the safety, belonging, and esteem levels of the hierarchy with the following subscales for each of the three levels: (a) need gratification, (b) need importance, (c) need salience, (d) self-concept (i.e., how much one is like a prototypical person at each level). Correlational data, gathered in a series of four studies, supported the reliability and validity of these subscales. Combining the four samples (N = 612), the MAS exhibited a Cronbach's α (averaged across subscales) of .89. With a subsample of 88, the subscales exhibited an average 6-week test-retest correlation of .83. As to validity evidence, safety self-concept correlated positively with depression and neuroticism and negatively with self-esteem, dominance, and desirability. Belonging selfconcept was negatively related to self-esteem and autonomy, while being positively related to neuroticism, depression, social recognition, and affiliation. An esteem level self-concept was positively related to self-acceptance, autonomy, dominance, and (inconsistently across studies) desirability. Across all three levels of the hierarchy, degree of need gratification was found to be positively related to selfesteem and negatively related to neuroticism and depression. © 1989.},

Measures of retrospective thought listings, pretest performance expectancies, actual test performance, post-test performance evaluations, and post-test measures of cognitive interference and physiological interference were obtained throughout an analog testing situation. Analyses of unstructured self-reports indicated that high test-anxious students, relative to moderate and low, reported a higher ratio of negative thoughts about themselves and a lower ratio of positive thoughts about the test. Analyses of structured self-reports indicated that high test-anxious students reported more cognitively interfering thoughts and mind wandering during the anagram test. Moreover, while high test-anxious students endorsed more thoughts concerned with physiological activation on the structured measure, inspection of thought listings revealed only one statement regarding physiological sensations. Finally, while anxiety groups did not differ significantly in pretest expectancies or actual test performance, high test-anxious students believed that they performed less successfully than students with less test anxiety. The findings illustrate that low test anxiety is not simply the opposite of high test anxiety and that perception of aversive physiological activity is not a salient component of test-anxious students' contents of consciousness. The results are interpreted as evidence for the usefulness of thought-listing assessments that classify thoughts on the basis of negative self-focused and task-facilitative thinking. © 1989.},

We report two investigations of the relation between social support and cognitive appraisal, one involving hypothetical events and one involving actual life events. In the first study perceptions of the number of potential providers of support were related to appraisals that negative outcomes were not consensual and were caused by stable and global factors. In the second study social withdrawal following a stressful experience was also related to appraisals involving low consensus, global attributions, and blame directed at personal inadequacy. These relations were independent of the level of self-rated depression and self-esteem at the time of the interview. It is argued that studies of social support processes need to take into account cognitive appraisals and powerful emotions such as shame and guilt. © 1989.},

We offer the argument that the Type A behavior pattern is a multidimensional concept that is theoretically embedded in a network of constructs. This network of relations is established empirically and derives meaning from an underlying theory. Moreover, the richness of predictions that follow from "a theory of Type A" far exceeds that which would be possible if self-report measures of Type A are viewed simply as measures of dominance. In addition, in contrast to Ray's position, we recommend further research into the behavioral expression of dominance, exhibited by Type As. However, whether or not Type A behavior is isomorphic with dominance, greater understanding of the modes of instrumental behavior of As and Bs, and of the conditions that elicit and maintain such behavior, should be rigorously pursued. © 1988.},

In the first experiment, the possibility that self-focus increases the memory for the cognitive operations used in generating words was examined. Self-focus, as produced by focusing on feelings, increased the accuracy of delayed recognition memory both for self-generated words, where more cognitive operations were used, and for the repetition of experimenter-supplied words, where fewer cognitive operations were used. Thus, self-focus did not increase memory more when more cognitive operations were used. Because the recognition memory in the initial experiment had been tested after a week, it was possible that the increase in recognition memory was due to an increase in the use of organization after self-focus. The likelihood of this possibility was strengthened when, in the second experiment, it was found that self-focus resulted in an increase in the automatic integration of propositions. In the third experiment after self-focus there was better memory for the connections formed in that experiment. Increased relating of material after self-focus is proposed as a mechanism by which self-focus affects performance. © 1988.},

We assessed this and the contending notion that, when the social climate permits, susceptible subjects attempt to cultivate the appearance and to engender the internal sense that their responses are occurring involuntarily. We found that susceptible subjects, under hypnotic as well as nonhypnotic conditions, engaged in cognitive activity which Sarbin (1981, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 364, 220-235; 1984, Psychological Record, 34, 537-549) proposed signifies a self-generated sense of involuntariness. This activity consisted of (1) the active mental construction of hypothetical situations in which suggested responses are involuntary events and (2) the avoidance of mentation in which the responses are construed as strategic enactments. This experience structuring activity occurred when the experimenter legitimized the occurrence of involuntary behavior by suggesting (rather than directly requesting) its occurrence and when the opportunity for self-focused attention was provided. The implications of these findings for special process and social psychological accounts of hypnotic responding are discussed. © 1988.},

Some studies find Type As taking credit for negative outcomes whereas other investigations find Type As externalizing responsibility for negative outcomes. The present experiment was designed to clarify these previous findings by asking Type A and B subjects to make attributions for hypothetical events that varied orthogonally in threat to self-esteem and in threat to control. Based on a control model of Type A behavior, it was predicted that Type As would be more likely than Type Bs to attribute events that threatened their control to internal factors which were potentially modifiable. In contrast, Type As should make more external attributions than Type Bs for those events that threatened their self-esteem. Accordingly, Jenkin's Activity Survey-defined Type A and B male college students were administered an attributional style questionnaire developed for this study. Results indicated that relative to Type Bs, Type As made greater internal but unstable attributions for negative events, particularly those which were high in threat to control. Both Type As and Bs made external attributions for negative events that were high in self-esteem threat but low in control threat. The implications of these findings for self-evaluative models of Type A behavior and Type A as a stress engendering behavior are discussed. © 1988.},

Each subject completed self-report inventories on present mood states. Heart rate, basal skin conductance level, spontaneous skin conductance responses, and absolute auditory threshold were recorded. Evidence of an overall decrease in arousal across testing sessions was found for the physiological data and the self-report data. These results support Gale's hypothesis that there are arousal properties associated with the psychophysiological laboratory per se that diminish with familiarity. In support of Eysenckian theory, temperament × stimulation level interactions were found. Extraverts displayed a decrease in physiologically measured arousal across days while introverts displayed no appreciable change. These results support Gale's hypothesis that arousal differences between introverts and extraverts will only emerge under conditions of moderate stimulation. Only on the first day of testing were there significant differences between neurotics and stable individuals on measured tension/anxiety, a result which could confound performance or behavioral measures used in one-session experiments. The results of this study support the use of measures of temperament in psychological research. Levels of stimulation interact with differences in temperament, and level of stimulation is evidently highest on an individual's first visit to the laboratory. © 1988.},

Then dyads consisting of an assertive or an unassertive man and an assertive or an unassertive woman were videotaped as they argued an issue. Measures derived from the tapes indicated that men talked more and louder than women did, as expected. Also, the hypotheses that assertive individuals would talk more and louder than unassertive ones were supported with some qualifications. However, only the assertiveness of women was associated with higher visual dominance patterns. Men's assertiveness had no influence on their visual behavior. Men paired with assertive women had lower visual dominance patterns than men paired with unassertive ones. Also, women showed another form of visual dominance, looking while speaking, more than men did. These results were compared with earlier studies of the behavior of women and men in same-sex and mixed-sex dyads and groups and in structured and unstructured discussion situations. © 1988.},

Self-monitoring (M. Snyder (1974) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology30, 526-537) refers to the tendency to tailor behavior to fit situational considerations. Image-based as opposed to quality-based advertisements emphasize the extrinsic rewards associated with the use of a product. It was found that people high in control orientation were also high in self-monitoring and preferred image- to quality-oriented advertisements. Since image preference has been previously related to high self-monitoring, we proposed that other correlates of self-monitoring might also be related to control orientation.

In Experiment 1, subjects faced either an easy, difficult, or impossible task in order to win $1.00.

An interaction was found such that task difficulty affected ratings in a nonmonotonic fashion in the immediate condition (inverted U) and in a negatively linear fashion in the delay condition. Based on these results, instrumental task difficulty was manipulated over two levels (easy and difficult) and cross-cut with a questionnaire length (short vs long) manipulation in Experiment 2. As predicted, goal ($1.00) attractiveness ratings, when obtained immediately prior to task commencement, were significantly higher upon a more salient interruption (i.e., the long questionnaire condition) only for those subjects assigned the easy task. In Experiment 3, task difficulty was manipulated in the same manner as Experiment 2 but was cross-cut with an interruption/no-interruption manipulation. Again as theoretically predicted, only in the easy task condition was goal attractiveness reliably higher when subjects were interrupted for dependent measure administration than when they were not. That is, goal ratings were a positive function of task difficulty in the no-interruption condition but were reliably higher and tended toward a negative pattern in the interruption condition. Theoretical and methodological implications of the three reliable interactions are discussed in terms of anticipatory energization and reactance arousal. © 1988.},

Eight judges rated the prototypicality of 120 varbally described acts for Norman's 40 marker traits. The prototypicality of each act was judged with respect to each trait. When the correlations among the prototypicality ratings were factor analyzed, Norman's Big Five could clearly be identified. This finding was replicated for the cross-correlations, and it was thus demonstrated that semantic bias is unimportant for the correlations among prototypicality ratings. It is argued that the five major factors of personality reflect basic dimensions of meaning that underlie the attribution of traits on the basis of the observation of behavior. © 1988.},

In Study 2 schematics and aschematics were compared on five different tasks that required elaboration of information about rights assertion conflict situations. Study 1 results revealed that schematics as compared to aschematics recalled more assertion related adjectives but did not differ in recall of domain-irrelevant words. Results from Study 2 showed that schematics as compared to aschematics recalled more past instances of assertive behaviors when asked to elaborate why an assertion adjective was endorsed as "Like me". Also, schematics were significantly more certain they would behave assertively both in situations where assertion was appropriate and in those where compromise was more appropriate. On two perceptual factors known to correlate with assertive behavior, schematics were more likely to judge moderately legitimate requests (i.e., ambiguous requests) as more unreasonable and when asked to generate expected consequences for assertive responses focused more on self rather than other person consequences. The consistency of the results with respect to various hypothesized functions of the self-schema construct are discussed. © 1988.},

Factor analyses of the results for classical authoritarianism replicated Phillips' earlier finding with younger schoolchildren that eight items identified as reflecting a sexist attitude loaded substantially on a first varimax rotated factor. These eight items constituted a reliable sexism scale (α = .80), which correlated significantly with the remainder of the classical authoritarianism scale, after controlling for the contribution of age (partial r = .30). However, the partial correlations with balanced measures of directiveness and attitude to authority were not significant. These results suggest that sexism may be one aspect of authoritarianism, rather than a central feature. © 1988.},

  abstract = {The Cook and Medley (1954) Hostility (Ho) scale has been found to predict coronary heart disease and general mortality. Previous research has indicated that the Ho scale primarily assesses a combination of anger proneness, resentment, and mistrust, and as a result can be viewed largely as a measure of cynical hostility. Previous, preliminary research has also indicated that cynically hostile persons report more stress and less social support, though such findings are not completely consistent across available studies. This psychosocial vulnerability, if indeed a consistent and pervasive correlate of hostility, is one potential link between Ho scores and disease. The present paper describes four studies examining psychosocial correlates of cynical hostility. Study 1 replicated previous findings of greater reported hassles and negative life events and less reported social support among high Ho scorers. Study 2 also replicated findings regarding general stress and support, and found more specifically that cynical hostility is associated with less reported support and higher reported conflict in the family. Study 3 found that Ho scores were associated with less marital satisfaction and more marital conflict, although this was more true for men than women. Study 4 indicated that cynical hostility was associated with greater reported stress in interpersonal aspects of work, with less job satisfaction, and with a negative view of work relationships. It is argued that this pattern of greater stress and less social support across domains represents an important psychosocial deficit or vulnerability-one potential link between cynical hostility and disease. © 1988.},

Data were collected again from the children 3 years later when they were in their late teenage years. Family Disruption and all of the mother constructs were significantly correlated in a positive direction. Mother Somatic Complaints and Mother Emotional Distress were not directly related to the child constructs; these effects were mediated through Family Disruption or Mother Drug Use. Mother Drug Use was significantly associated with their children's Drug Use, Socially Deviant Attitudes, and Emotional Distress during early adolescence. Mother Drug Use did not directly influence the child's qualities or behavior in late adolescence; these effects were mediated through the early adolescent constructs. Family Disruption was significantly related to the Child's Drug Use and Socially Deviant Attitudes during early adolescence and had a significant impact upon Emotional Distress at late adolescence. When all effects were considered simultaneously in a theoretically driven model, Socially Deviant Attitudes had the largest direct impact on early drug use, whereas the impact of the family context variables and the other child constructs on drug use was mediated through deviant attitudes. An alternate, competing hypothesis that child drug use generated child deviant attitudes was rejected empirically. © 1988.},

The present three studies examine the self-regulation approach to Type A. Study I found that Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS) scores were correlated with trait measures of high standards for success, self-criticism, and positive expectancies for success. Further, this self-regulation profile was distinct from that associated with dysphoria. Study II replicated these self-regulation findings for the JAS and demonstrated similar though weaker relationships when Type A behavior was assessed with the Type A structured interview (SI). The Framingham Type A Scale (FTAS), however, was associated with dysphoric self-regulation processes. Study III examined the influence of situational standards for performance on self-regulation behaviors. JAS-defined Type As were less satisfied with their task performances than were Type Bs, but only when situational standards were lacking. FTAS-defined Type As were less satisfied than were Type Bs, but their dissatisfaction was constant across conditions. SI-defined Type A behavior was unrelated to situational self-regulation responses. Thus, these results suggest that the self-regulation approach may provide a useful account of the Type A behaviors assessed by the JAS, but also that it may not be an accurate model of other aspects of the Type A pattern. © 1988.},

  abstract = {D. C. Glass (1977, Behaviour patterns, stress and coronary disease, Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum) has suggested that Type A behaviors reflect an attempt to assert control over uncontrollable environmental events. As formulated, this position does not explain why some individuals may be more likely to engage in such behaviors than others. One possible explanation is that Type A individuals are more sensitive to actual or impending loss of control than Type B's. Another is that Type A's may be more likely to deny control over events than Type B's. In the present study a contingency judgment paradigm was used to examine these potential differences. Signal detection methods were used to distinguish between sensitivity to variations in control and willingness to acknowledge control. Forty male undergraduates were categorized as Type A or B on the basis of their Jenkins Activity Survey scores. In a subsequent laboratory task, they judged the amount of control their responding (pressing a key on a microcomputer) had over an environmental outcome (onset of a light). Actual degree of control was manipulated by varying the conditional probability of the outcome given no response, p ( O NR) and given a response, p ( O R). Half the time the outcome was uncontrollable, p ( O NR) = p ( O R), and half the time it was imperfectly controllable, p ( O R) >p ( O NR). Results indicated that Type A subjects were more sensitive to variations in contingency while simultaneously tending to deny influence over the outcome even when influence was possible. Implications of these perceptual/cognitive differences with respect to the behavioral and psychophysiological characteristics of Type A individuals are discussed, and suggestions for further research are highlighted. © 1988.},

The implications of this distinction were examined by comparing several shyness scales with Eysenck and Eysenck's (1968, The manual of the Eysenck Personality Inventory, San Diego, CA: Educational and Industrial Testing Service) measures of introversion and neuroticism. The results show (1) that shyness items (as well as scales) correlate about equally with measures of introversion and neuroticism, suggesting that the construct of shyness should be located somewhere between these orthogonal dimensions; and (2) that only two items on the Eysencks' scales seem to measure shyness directly-their scales apparently correlate with shyness primarily because they assess constructs related to shyness such as sociability and self-esteem. © 1988.},

Reaction times revealed faster verification of necessary inferences by FI learners. For FD readers, necessary inferences took longer to verify than paraphrases. Error data showed no FI-FD differences, but working memory capacity was larger for FI than for FD learners and was related to unnecessary inference accuracy.

All of the subjects then had to administer rewards and punishments to a peer, supposedly as they directed that person's "shots" at a "target." Questionnaire ratings indicated that the people who could readily escape were not as angry as the others, suggesting that they were less frustrated than their counterparts not given permission to escape. The former were evidently also less bothered by the painfully cold water, apparently because they believed they had some control over this aversive stimulation. Nevertheless, the men in the cold water condition who were relatively free to escape from this unpleasant situation were most punitive to their partner. The aversive stimulation apparently evoked an inclination to strike at an available target even when it was possible to terminate the painful event. © 1987.},

Novel analyses of data from the Institute for Sex Research are also carried out, indicating that American blacks, compared to American whites, are more precocious and less restrained. Their parents were younger when they were born, had more children, and had an earlier mortality. Blacks left home earlier, experienced a variety of premarital, marital, and extramarital sexual events earlier, had a greater number of premarital and extramarital partners, had a greater frequency of marital intercourse, used fewer contraceptives, and had a greater incidence of pregnancy, at a faster rate. The men had larger penises, at a different angle of erection, and maintained intromission longer, while the women had shorter menstrual cycles, more periodicity of sexual response, and a greater number of orgasms per act of coitus. Whites varied their sexual activity more, both with spouses and with prostitutes, although blacks consorted with prostitutes more frequently.

These hypotheses were assessed in a sample of college women for both their first experiences of intercourse and for their recent sexual experiences with subsequent partners. Tests of the incremental effects of two heterosocial anxiety factors when controlling for several covariates showed the following results. For a woman's first intercourse experience, general heterosocial anxiety was inversely correlated to when birth control was discussed, male partner's communication effectiveness, and use of more effective contraceptive methods. For recent intercourse experiences, general heterosocial anxiety was inversely correlated to who initiated discussion about birth control and male partner's communication effectiveness, while contraceptive task anxiety was inversely correlated to use of more effective contraceptive methods in a couple's subsequent sexual relations but not their initial sexual encounter. Results are discussed relative to the social anxiety literature and for limitations that restrict conclusions about the degree of influence that social anxiety may exert on contraceptive behavior. © 1987.},

Prior to his death, Brickman developed a brief measure, the Internal-External Correspondence Scale (ICS), designed to assess individual differences in the preference that one's behavior be internally versus externally correspondent. The present authors have refined Brickman's original, unpublished version of the ICS and report evidence for the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity (e.g., convergent/discriminant validity and predictive validity) of the revised version. This evidence supports specific predictions found in Brickman's (1978) theoretical formulation. It further reveals that internal correspondence functions as a personal moderating variable, such that the behavior of high internally correspondent subjects is strongly correlated with their feelings and dispositions, whereas the behavior of low internally correspondent subjects is only weakly correlated with their feelings and dispositions. © 1987.},

In Experiment 1, outcome, locus of control, and the resultant achievement motivation × outcome interaction predicted level of intrinsic motivation, thereby substantiating the claim that individual differences are important in the prediction of intrinsic motivation. Experiment 2 tested the impact of each individual difference on intrinsic motivation-relevant moderating processes (performance expectancy, actual and perceived performance, and affect) to highlight the processes by which individual differences function to impact level of intrinsic motivation. It was shown that need for achievement affected level of intrinsic motivation through the high achievers' favorably biased performance expectancy and heightened positive affect, and, after losing, through both a favorable actual and perceived performance relative to low achievers, High anxiety impacted level of intrinsic motivation by depreciating performance expectancy and actual performance relative to low levels of anxiety. For locus of control, internals showed a higher level of intrinsic motivation than externals via a more favorable performance expectancy and, after winning, via greater positive affect and a more successful perceived performance appraisal. © 1987.},

The first is mediated by a rotation of perceptual axes, normally involved in the maintenance of orientation constancy, and the second involves a distortion in perceived angles between the rod and the frame sides. Individual differences in orientation perception are related to the embedded-figures test as expected, but they are just as highly related to many other tests of spatial-visual abilities.

  abstract = {Gray's model has been employed in attempts to formulate theories concerning the processes underlying various types of psychopathology. In the most direct application of his model, the dominant mood is assumed to reflect the strength of the underlying motivational system-i.e., strong anxiety with a strong behavioral inhibition system (BIS), strong positive affect with a strong behavioral activation system (BAS). This approach would predict strong anxiety to be associated with a dominance of passive avoidance and extinction and, similarly, strong positive affect with a dominance of impulsivity and other approach behaviors. The present paper has argued that these expectations are based on an implicit assumption that equally stressful environments are encountered-an assumption that would be undermined by individual differences in the very motivational systems under consideration. Examination of the approach-avoidance conflict paradigm supported the argument that, at least in the case of anxiety, one should not expect a strong association between behavior and motivational states. In particular, a weak behavioral inhibition system or strong behavioral activation system is likely to facilitate anxiety-producing impulsive behavior, whereas a strong behavioral inhibition system or weak behavioral activation system may facilitate anxiety-reducing cautious behavior. Other factors were also thought to promote independence of affective states and behavioral traits across individuals. On this argument, trait anxiety conceptualized as resulting from a strong BIS may not be highly correlated with frequent anxiety. Stating this another way, the behavioral correlates of a dominant BIS may be relatively independent of a trait involving a dominance of anxious mood. Using Tellegen's (1985) discussion of self-report measures of mood and personality traits, it was proposed that the trait factor of Constraint may be more strongly associated with behavioral consequences of the BAS and BIS, whereas the Negative Emotionality dimension is largely unrelated to the behavioral effects of the BIS. Since Negative Emotionality corresponds to the traditional anxiety/neuroticism factor, this proposal differs from the customary assumptions about the alignment of Gray's motivational systems and personality traits. The personality trait of Positive Emotionality (cf. extraversion) may be associated with individual differences in the strength of the BAS, with both affective and behavioral components. Thus, the hypothesis of motivational-behavioral uncoupling offers an alternative to the usual intepretations of the three major dimensions seen in most personality inventories. Unfortunately, it remains unclear as to how well the three major personality traits (Positive Emotionality, Negative Emotionality, and Constraint) are aligned with the hypothesized underlying motivational dimensions, and any hypotheses must be seen as extremely tentative. Finally, the question of the validity of self-report measures was discussed briefly. Of greatest interest is the possibility that a subset of subjects are unable to accurately report their emotional states, and that methods are available for identifying these individuals. If so, the validity of these self-report measures may be significantly improved, facilitating research on anxiety and impulsivity. © 1987.},

The results provide evidence that (a) in comparison to controls, extraverts and psychopaths fail to use cues for punishment to inhibit incorrect approach responses; (b) the deficient response inhibition of disinhibited subjects is specific to approach-avoidance situations; (c) under conditions involving monetary rewards and punishments, disinhibited subjects are less likely to slow down, and may even respond more quickly, following punishment; and (d) the tendency to speed up rather than slow down following punishment is associated with failure to learn from punishment. The results suggest that once focused on obtaining reward, extraverts and psychopaths display an active (disinhibited) as opposed to a passive (reflective) reaction to punishment and frustrative nonreward. This reaction to punishment appears to interfere with learning cues for punishment and may underlie the poor passive avoidance learning and impulsive behavior that characterize the syndromes of disinhibition. © 1987.},

The research involves a wide spectrum of techniques in an effort to find consistent relationships among biological, cognitive, behavioral, and environmental correlates of the personality traits. The goal is to develop unique profiles of personality traits based on these four classes of measurements. Our research has demonstrated that impulsiveness and anxiety are personality traits that have loadings on two orthogonal higher order personality factors that we have labeled action-oriented and mood-feeling. From both an empirical research and a clinical viewpoint, we have identified three subtraits of impulsiveness: cognitive (Ic), motor (Im), and nonplanning (Inp). Inp is hypothesized to relate to frontal lobe brain processes, while Ic and Im are more related to neural mechanisms that (1) control performance on tasks with "timing-and-rhythm" demands and/or (2) are related to seizure disorders. High-impulsive subjects (especially when high on Ic and Im) are less efficient at performing a wide range of psychomotor tasks. We hypothesize that this inefficiency relates to the information-gating properties of the nervous system being out of "synch" with efficient performance of selected tasks. High-impulsive subjects are visual N100 event-related potential augmentors, which would be consistent with this dyssynchrony occurring in the early stages of information processing. We also hypothesize that impulsiveness is related to serotonin (high impulsiveness related to low serotonin levels). Our psychopharmacological-psychophysiological studies of information processing would be consistent with the latter hypothesis. © 1987.},

Three types of stressors were examined related to the academic environment, social/familial issues, and personal performance. Internals and externals did not differ in their appraisal of social stressors. Internals, compared with externals, perceived less threat and more mutability when appraising personal performance stressors. In contrast, when appraising stressors in the academic environment internals actually perceived less mutability than externals. More importantly, however, internals accepted academic stressors perceived to be unchangeable, whereas externals did not. The observed I-E/situational stressor interactions were in line with expectations from existing theory. The fact that appraisal was better predicted by the interaction of person and situation factors rather than by either factor alone lends support to a cognitive-phenomenological model of stress. © 1987.},

The Aggression and Defendence scales of the PRF were combined to form a measure of hostility (PRF-hostility) and relationships between need for power, hostility, and TABP were examined. Results showed that these motivational variables were not directly related to TABP. However, there was a strong interaction such that Type As high in need for power tended to score highly on PRF-hostility and Type Bs high in need for power tended to rate themselves as low on PRF-hostility.

The foundation notions of the hypothesis are (1) that a basic requirement of living things is ongoing activity in the form of a continuous stream of behavior and (2) that this continuing stream of behavior may be seen as a continuous stream of reactions wholly in response to a continuing stream of situations. Four types of situations comprise the stream matrix-externally produced "external" situations, externally produced "internal" situations, internally produced "internal" situations and internally produced "external" situations. The dynamics of the situational stream matrix are discussed with special emphasis on the role of "personality" as a situation generating system and on several commonly observed behavior patterns (e.g., emotions and defense mechanisms) as stream maintenance devices. Following the exposition of the situational stream hypothesis, the conceptualization is applied to an understanding of adaptive and maladaptive patterns of personality. New methodologies based upon the stream perspective are also presented. © 1987.},

The present studies sought to explore the generalizability of such findings to (1) a more naturalistic setting (Study 1) and (2) a behavioral domain different from task performance (Study 2). Study 1 explored the impact of students' self-esteem and feedback from an initial course examination on their subsequent exam performance. As expected, low SEs performed much worse than high SEs subsequent to the receipt of negative feedback; following positive feedback the two groups performed equally on the subsequent exam. In Experiment 2, participants played the role of managers who had just received feedback that their willingness to communicate certain information either elicited negative outcomes (negative feedback condition) or did not (control condition). As predicted, low SEs expressed much less motivation than high SEs to communicate related information in the former than the latter condition, especially if the negative feedback was more threatening to their well-being in the organization. There were no differences between the two groups in the control condition. Theoretical and practical implications and limitations of the findings are discussed. © 1987.},

Ninety-five male and 125 female undergraduates completed questionnaires measuring sense of humor, negative life events, and depressive and physical symptomatology. Contrary to expectations, hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed no evidence that humor moderates the impact of negative life events on either depression or physical illness. Instead, the results suggested that sense of humor directly mitigates depression only, independent of the effects of life stress.

Procrastination was positively related to measures of disorganization and independent of need-achievement, energy level, and self-esteem. High scorers on the procrastination scale were more likely to return their completed inventory late. Procrastination was unrelated to grade-point average (R = -10). In Study II, subjects completed Form G of the procrastination scale and a variation of Little's (1983) Personal Projects Questionnaire. Based on ratings of their personal projects, procrastinators and nonprocrastinators were distinguished in a number of ways, foremost being the nonprocrastinator's more positive response to the project dimension of stress and the procrastinator's greater sensitivity to how enjoyable the project was in terms of time spent. In Study III, after completing a personality inventory, air-passengers awaiting their flight departure were asked to take an envelope with them and to mail it back on a designated date. Procrastinators were less accurate in doing so than were nonprocrastinators. Various aspects of procrastinatory behavior were discussed, including a reconsideration of the defining of the construct. © 1986.},

For example, for 20 years or more researchers have acknowledged that some major personality constructs such as anxiety exhibit both trait (relatively stable, interindividual) and state (intraindividual) variability. However, the consideration that state variability might be quite general and can "intrude" in the measurement of putatively more stable attributes has not generally entered into construct validation work and other manifestations of theoretical development. Locus of control, as with many personality constructs, is considered to be a dimension of relatively stable interindividual differences. Levenson's three-dimensional locus of control scale was adapted for use in a measurement-intensive P-technique study involving 10 participants (5 mothers and fathers who were expecting their first child) to examine the extent to which responses manifested systematic liability. The data indicated that perceived locus of control exhibits coherent, day-to-day variability; especially the dimensions identified as internality and powerful others. Such state variation manifestations are discussed in relation to their important implications for measurement, long-term prediction, and theorizing about the nature of personality. © 1986.},

F. Scheier (1976, Journal of Research in Personality, 10, 463-468) suggested that the habitual self-focus of private self-conscious individuals would lead them to attribute their positive and negative outcomes to internal causes, and their data support these predictions. This potential contradiction in the literature was examined in three studies. Each study was a nearly exact or conceptual replication of the experiment of Buss and Scheier. In none of the studies did persons high in private self-consciousness make more internal attributions for events than those low in private self-consciousness.

An equal number of the descriptors were masculine, feminine, and gender neutral in connotation, with half of each group positively and half negatively valenced. The prediction from gender schema theory was that sex-typed persons would process gender consistent information faster (shorter reaction time to say "me" or "not me") than gender inconsistent information, the reverse would hold for the cross-sex-typed group, and that no differences would obtain for androgynous or undifferentiated subjects. Two methods for operationalizing a gender consistent versus a gender inconsistent response were tested with each offering support for sex-typed and andogynous subjects, and mixed support depending on subject's sex for cross-sex-typed persons. These results held across stimulus valence (positive and negative), suggesting that both socially desirable and undesirable characteristics are salient in processing gender information.

Fearful in contrast to self-conscious shys reported a greater degree of somatic anxiety, and fearful shy men reported significantly greater behavioral inhibition than did all other groups. Results for shyness differences in competence showed that, compared to nonshys, both shy groups reported less satisfaction with their physical appearance. Fearful shys were less knowledgeable about effective social skills, and both shy groups reported less consideration and less exploration of occupations requiring interpersonal contact.

  issn = {00926566},
  abstract = {A central assumption of a cognitive theory of emotion is that affect terms contain a large amount of information about the kinds of situations that elicited them. To the extent that various situations elicit the same feelings in everyone, reactions to situations that arouse the same emotion should be described by affect terms that are more or less synonymous: groups of affect terms should be defined by the fact that terms within each group are used in response to some situations and not in response to others. To test this hypothesis, 81 subjects were presented with 170 imaginary situations, and asked to describe (using one term of their own choosing) how most people would feel as the central character in that situation, and to describe how they themselves would feel. Similarity coefficients between all pairs of 197 affect terms were computed, using situations as N. Factor analysis of the variance-covariance matrix of similarity coefficients yielded 32 (out of 32) semantically coherent clusters of affect terms. The results were interpreted to mean that affects normatively have situational (and therefore cognitive) antecedents as well as connotative meanings, modes of bodily expression, and consequences for action. It is further suggested that the situational meanings of affect terms are important if one wishes to use a subject's feelings about a situation to predict his subsequent behavior. © 1986.},

The predicted self-efficacy-outcome interaction emerged, though only on the most salient causal factors. Feedback that was inconsistent with perceptions of efficacy was more likely to be attributed to external factors than was expectancy consistent information. Perceptions of self-efficacy were also associated with anxiety, raising the possibility that the self-efficacy-attribution relation was mediated by arousal.

Ekehammer (1978, Journal of Research in Personality, 12, 41-48), individual correlations between self-reported behavior patterns and perceived similarity ratings across anxiety-provoking situations are obtained as measures of coherence. Unlike the Magnusson and Ekehammar study, the present measures of situation cognition and behavior are based on an idiographic sampling of anxiety-provoking situations. As a step toward concept-based measurement of situation cognition, further measures of perceived situational similarity are derived from the script, prototype, and social episodes models in social psychology and correlated with cross-situational similarity of behavioral profiles. It is demonstrated, in comparison with the findings of Magnusson and Ekehammar, that correlations between similarity ratings and behavior patterns increase substantially as a result of an idiographic sampling of situations. Moreover, it is shown that "script," "prototype," and "social episode" measures can be utilized to investigate the covariation between situation cognition and behavior, thus contributing to the clarification of the principles of cognitive representation of situational experience. © 1986.},

However, within-subject analyses indicated that the emotions did differ in their perceived causes, thus supporting predictions from Weiner's attributional model of emotion.

As hypothesized, the macho personality, r(173) = .33, p < .001, and specifically the Calloused Sex Attitudes subscale, r(173) = .53, was correlated with a history of sexual aggression. To study the effects of macho personality, a history of sexual aggression, and the treatment variables of rapist-force and victim-resistance on men's subjective sexual arousal and emotional experiences during the guided imagining of a realistic, noneroticized rape, 125 men returned for a second session in which they were randomly assigned by groups to four conditions, two levels of rapist-force × two levels of victim-resistance. Macho personality was related to experiencing less affective disgust, anger, fear, distress, shame, contempt, and guilt as the men imagined committing a rape, confirming a portion of the hypothesis. Men with a history of sexual aggression experienced more interest and subjective sexual arousal, as hypothesized, but they also, contrary to expectations, experienced more affective anger, distress, fear, shame, and guilt. These results were discussed as evidence of the construct validity of the macho personality constellation and as reflecting the revivification of moodcongruent, state memories in the men with a history of sexual aggression. © 1986.},

These approaches view individual differences in physiological reactivity as a static, general trait (associated with Type A behavior) that is activated by environmental challenges and demands to produce the heightened transitory state of physiological arousal. An alternative, transactional approach to this problem is offered. Briefly, Type As are seen as not simply responding to challenge and demand with enhanced reactivity. Instead, they are seen as creating such situations through their choices, cognitions, and behaviors. Empirical evidence for the Type A demand and challenge-engendering style is reviewed, and its potential impact on physiological reactivity is detailed. Further, the implications of this transactional approach for the assessment and modification of Type A behavior, reactivity and related CHD risk are discussed. © 1986.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development and validation of a general causality orientations scale. Causality orientations are conceptualized as relatively enduring aspects of people that characterize the source of initiation and regulation, and thus the degree of self-determination, of their behavior. Three orientations-autonomy, control, and impersonal-are measured by the three subscales of the instrument. Individuals are given a score on each orientation, thus allowing the use of the theoretically appropriate subscale (or, in some cases, a combination of subscales) to predict affects, cognitions, and behaviors. The scale was shown to have internal consistency and temporal stability. The orientations were shown to fit appropriately into a nomological network of constructs and to relate to various behaviors that were hypothesized to be theoretically relevant. © 1985.},

  abstract = {Existing research on the relative efficacy of the self as an encoding structure applies more to the self as an object than as a cognitive structure that guides the organization of incoming information. In order to provide a task that would be more directly relevant to encoding, subjects were asked to watch an interview of a resident assistant (RA) candidate by the housing department and to attend throughout to how similar the candidate's presentation was to the one they themselves or a typical RA would have given in the situation. Furthermore, judgments of similarity were divided into personality, ability, and nonverbal style. The dependent variable was a surprise cued-recall task, administered 20 min after the videotaped interview had ended. Consistent with prediction, subjects instructed to encode from a self-perspective exhibited better recall than those instructed to encode from a typical RA perspective. Also, as predicted, subjects who judged personality or ability similarity recalled more of the interview than those who judged nonverbal style similarity. Enhanced recall from the self-encoding perspective was consistent across all three types of judgments (personality, ability, nonverbal style), suggesting that the self is an efficient processing structure across a variety of diverse judgment topics. © 1985.},

Factor analysis identified three aspects: subordination of personal to group goals, the ingroup as extension of the self, and ingroup identity. The scales also had satisfactory discriminant validity. Those high on idiocentric tendencies used equity and those high in allocentric tendencies used equality and need in distributing rewards. A second study found that those who are allocentric are more likely to emphasize the values of cooperation, equality, and honesty, and those who are idiocentric to emphasize the values of comfortable life, competition, pleasure, and social recognition. Those who were allocentric reported receiving more social support and a better quality of social support; those who were idiocentric were higher in achievement motivation, alienation, anomie, and reported greater loneliness. © 1985.},

There were no effects of socialization on the accuracy of classification by the semiobjective field scoring or the discriminant function.

Evidence indicates that construct-based scales are substantially more reliable, generally more valid, and have lower correlations with irrelevant sources of variance. Burisch's defense of global trait measures using single-item adjective scales is found wanting. Greater criterion validity and several other advantages recommend the use of aggregated concrete behavioral exemplars as personality measures.

Based on a review of selected empirical studies and analyses of new data, Burisch has concluded that (a) single-item global self-ratings generally yield greater coefficients of criterion validity than questionnaire measures of the same traits, and (b) most existing personality questionnaires can be shortened considerably without any consequent loss in validity. These conclusions stand in direct contrast to previous appeals by Epstein and others for the use of extensive aggregate measures of personality derived according to the axioms of psychometric theory. In response to Burisch, we describe measurement artifacts and strategies of test item selection that account for some of his conclusions and we reiterate the need for the application of conventional construct-based questionnaires in the assessment of personality. © 1985.},

Our intent was to clarify the effects of different levels of self-esteem and performance satisfaction on causal internalization of academic performance. Subjects were 162 university students who attributed causality for their individual performances on a midterm examination. Attributions to four internal and four external causal sources were analyzed with a 2 × 2 (Self-Concept × Performance Satisfaction) MANOVA and with follow-up univariate F ratios. Most of the findings support the predictions based on self-esteem theory; i.e., satisfaction with performance, rather than consistency of performance with self-esteem, served as the primary influence on internalization of causality, with students internalizing satisfying outcomes more than dissatisfying outcomes. Cognitive-consistency theory and B. Weiner's (1979, Journal of Educational Psychology, 71, 3-25) attribution proposal regarding maintenance of a stable self-concept also received support, as attributions to the internal and stable causal sources of ability and general effort were a function of an interaction of self-esteem and performance satisfaction. Hence, neither self-theory adequately anticipated the effects of self-esteem and performance satisfaction on causal internalization. Rather, a consolidation of theories is needed to explain the results. © 1985.},

These aspects of dominance bear close resemblance to the Perceived Physical Ability (PPA) and the Physical Self-Presentation Confidence (PSPC) dimensions of the Physical Self-Efficacy (PSE) Inventory. Accordingly, the PPA and PSPC scores of undergraduate men and women were correlated with their scores on the Personal Orientation Inventory (POI), a popular measure of actualization, to test Maslow's hypotheses. The results showed that, contrary to Maslow's claims, PPA is not a positive correlate of self-actualization. However, strong support was found for Maslow's contention that high-PSPC individuals are more likely to be actualizing than low-PSPC people. Also, Maslow's hypothesis that actualizers are high in global sensation seeking (SS) was tested. The data indicated that only male actualizers were high in various aspects of SS, but female actualizers were not. Multiple regression analyses revealed further that both SS and PSPC are primary contributors to POI for men, but only PSPC contributes significantly to POI for women. Discussion focused on the reasons why research findings showing that increases in physical fitness lead to increases in self-esteem cannot be used to support the view that physical fitness and actualization are linked positively. © 1985.},

Further analysis revealed two major types of planned helping: (a) formal, organizational helping and (b) informal helping between friends and family. Study 2 examined a variety of intrapsychic and demographic correlates of formal and informal planned helping. Study 3 found support for the hypothesis that people in helping professions have higher levels of involvement in everyday planned helping than do people in nonhelping occupations.

For students who were familiar with their current environment, self-esteem was positively related to confidence in having a good memory. It was only for newcomers-students who had recently moved to a new environment-that beliefs about the benefits of environmental cues were positively related to self-esteem and assertiveness. These results suggested that if newcomers were less aware of the utility of environmental cues, they were more likely to attribute their memory failures to their own inadequacies. We also obtained evidence that subjects with an internal locus of control were more knowledgeable regarding the utility of environmental cues than were externally oriented subjects. © 1985.},

Later, subjects listened to a second passage depicting either nonconsenting or consenting sex. Their perceptions of the second portrayal and their beliefs in rape myths were then measured. The findings provided support for the hypothesis that media depictions suggesting that rape results in the victim's arousal can contribute to men's beliefs in a similar rape myth. Moreover, analysis of the mediating role of individual differences indicated that men with relatively higher inclinations to aggress against women are particularly likely to be affected by media depictions of rape myths. It is suggested that these data may be explained best on the basis of information retrieval processes.

It was hypothesized that undergoing periodontal surgery would be perceived as a combination ambiguous/physical danger situation. Accordingly it was predicted that high-ambiguous A-Trait subjects would experience greater decreases in A-State than low-ambiguous A-Trait subjects in proceeding from the high-stress to the low-stress condition. Similarly it was predicted that high-physical danger A-Trait subjects would show greater decreases in A-State than low-physical danger A-Trait subjects. Significant A-Trait × stress condition interactions were not expected to occur for noncongruent A-Trait facets (social evaluation and innocuous). Results indicated that, while the high-stress condition was perceived as an ambiguous/physical danger situation, the A-Trait × stress condition interactions were not significant for ambiguous, physical danger, or innocuous A-Trait facets. Contrary to prediction, a significant interaction was observed between social evaluation A-Trait and stress condition.

  abstract = {Based on a self-presentational approach to social anxiety, it was hypothesized that (1) low social anxiety individuals respond to the expectation of further personal interaction with another person by increasing the favorability of their self-presentations; (2) high social anxiety individuals do not increase the favorability of their self-presentations when they expect further interaction, and (3) positive evaluations from an interaction partner tend to reduce differences between low and high social anxiety individuals. To test these hypotheses, individuals previously determined to be either low or high in dispositional social anxiety were asked to write 10 self-descriptive statements to be passed to an opposite sex partner, with whom the subjects either would or would not engage in further personal interaction. Prior to writing the self-descriptions, subjects were given either positive or neutral evaluations, supposedly written by the other person. The results supported the first two, but not the third, hypotheses. The implications of these findings for a self-presentational model of social anxiety were discussed. © 1985.},

The SPS correlated positively with self-monitoring and showed a curvilinear relation to a manifest anxiety measure. It related significantly to measures of time depiction and showed trends regarding a need for intimacy. Males obtained higher scores than females, and factor patterns, while varying for sex, showed parallels with traditional descriptors of psychopathy. © 1985.},

The measures used were the Defining Issues Test and a specially designed attitude survey. As predicted, the differences between resisters and nonresisters were in the realm of cognitive beliefs and values. Strong rejection of political and social authority, a belief that individual conscience is a better guide to conduct than the law, a professed unwillingness to be in positions of authority over others, and a lack of conventional religious affiliation significantly differentiated the resisters from the nonresisters. The resisters also measured high in level of moral judgment but were significantly different only from the conservatives. © 1985.},

Subjects were presented with a sequence of stressful (loud white noise) and benign (illumination of a green light) events in association with a series of discrete stimuli (alphabetic letters) in three conditions of counterstress activity. Results generally supported the predicted tendency to learn probability information primarily in conditions which reflected the subjects' characteristic ways of responding to stress. Obsessive-compulsives acquired the information primarily in a "ritualistic" context, controls in an active coping context, and dysphorics in both a coping deficit context and unexpectedly in an active coping context.

Study 1 also found social interest negatively related to a narcissistic life goal, personality rigidity, and negative interpersonal behavior (Drivenness). Study 2 correlated social interest with the Personality Research Form and found, as expected, that social interest is correlated with the Affiliation and Nurturance scales. Unfortunately, social interest was not negatively related to Aggression. Finally, Study 3 provided generally positive support for the hypothesized relationships between social interest and several variables from the Life Styles Inventory (e.g., Humanism, Affiliation, etc.).

Houston (1983, Journal of Research in Personality, 17, 22-39) concluded that there is a reliable but relatively weak association between Type A (coronary-prone) behavior and heightened physiologic reactivity. D. S. Holmes (1983, Journal of Research in Personality, 17, 40-47) contends that by failing to take into account dependent measures yielding null results, Houston overestimated the consistency with which A/B differences have been obtained. In the present article, we show that it is critical to take into account the method used to assess Type A behavior. Structured Interview assessments show a more consistent association with reactivity than those based on the Jenkins Activity Survey. We then point out that, for certain physiologic measures, null effects do not necessarily reflect an absence of A/B differences in sympathetic-adrenomedullary activity. Other issues that are discussed include the role of situational parameters in eliciting hyperresponsiveness in Type A's, the problem of evaluating the magnitude and importance of A/B effects, and the need for a more theoretical approach to the study of Type A behavior. © 1985.},

Greenberg, 1983, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 19, 21-48) recently argued that the magnitude of goal valence (the attractiveness or unattractiveness of a potential outcome) varies directly with motivational arousal level. Motivational arousal, in turn, is thought to be a function of the perceived difficulty of goal attainment. This formulation was tested in the present study by examining the relationship between goal attractiveness ratings and performance on an anagram task. According to the Yerkes-Dodson law (R. M. Yerkes & J. D. Dodson, 1908, Journal of Comparative Neurological Psychology, 18, 459-482), the relationship between motivational arousal and performance should be curvilinear; optimal performance is usually observed for moderate levels of motivation relative to either low or very high motivation levels. Consistent with the Brehm et al. hypothesis, optimum performance in the present study was observed for subjects who reported moderate levels of goal attractiveness relative to subjects who reported either low or high levels of goal attractiveness. Anticipatory ratings of the difficulty of the anagrams were also congruent with the Brehm et al. model. These findings converge with data from other studies supporting the utility of goal attractiveness as an index of motivational arousal and provide an additional dimension of support for the model proposed by Brehm et al. © 1985.},

Other subjects in this condition showed the usual attributional error. These findings were generally replicated in the second study, which used the Constraint condition only.

Subjects in fourth and seventh grade were asked whether a story hero would transgress and were required to justify their answers. In addition, questions regarding affective reactions to transgressions, confessions, and due punishment were asked. Fourth grade children answering in the good child instructions condition tended to give significantly different responses than under neutral instructions, while seventh grade subjects did not tend to differentiate between these two instruction conditions. While adult theories of morality would predict a differentiation between good and bad child instructions, on some of the measures no differences were found between good and bad child instructions.

  abstract = {In recent approaches to social judgment, information distortion has been discussed primarily as a violation of individual rationality, due to unintentionally occurring biases. In contrast to this view, it is argued that frequently individuals make purposive use of selective changes in information processing in order to avoid indecisiveness. In this sense, selective changes in information processing may be considered a functional requirement of a volitional process which protects the current intention (or tentative decision) from being replaced by competing behavioral tendencies. On the basis of J. Kuhl's theory of action control (1981, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 40, 155-170; 1982, in W. Hacker, W. Volpert, & M. von Cranach, Eds., Cognitive and Motivational Aspects of Action, Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1984, in B. A. Maher, Progress in Experimental Personality Research, Vol. 13, New York: Academic Press) it was predicted that subjects having a high score on the action-control scale (i.e., action-oriented subjects) should show a stronger tendency to increase the attractiveness rating of a tentatively preferred decision during the process of decision making than subjects scoring low on that scale (i.e., state-oriented subjects). To test this assumption, students searching for an apartment were offered 16 apartments along with a list containing information about the alternatives. The subjects had to rate the attractiveness of each apartment twice before they were asked to indicate which apartments they would like to rent. The results confirmed the predictions. It was found that action-oriented subjects increased the divergence of their attractiveness ratings from the first to the second point of evaluation, whereas state-oriented subjects did not. © 1984.},

Performance on some of these tasks strongly embodied the features of these criterial trait constructs while performance on other tasks did not.

Use was made of standard statistical procedures as well as discriminant analysis. The most noteworthy finding was that subjects were able to utilize the first-order factor structure for the continuum extraversion/introversion in a discriminating manner and to assign such factors in a fairly clear-cut way to three extreme body types. Personality appraisals of the mesomorphic body type and an ideal type (composed by the subjects) were shown to be virtually identical.

No differences in personality appraisals by male (n = 50) and female (n = 50) subjects with the exception of factor Q2 by the ectomorphic body type were found. Both male and female subjects showed a preference for the (male) mesomorphic body type although significant differences between male and female subjects in the pattern of their distribution of preferences over the three body types were found.

Field-dependent subjects were significantly more extreme in their confidence judgments, particularly in the exonerating conditions. They also showed nonsignificantly poorer recall. In Experiment 2, forty-eight subjects from Experiment 1 were given arguments biased in the opposite direction of their original sets. Field-dependent subjects were significantly more likely to shift their confidence judgments and report discomfort when the new information suggested innocence, and to underrecall new information when it suggested guilt. Field-dependent subjects again showed poorer recall. The results of both experiments were discussed in terms of their support for a field-dependence value bias and encoding deficiency. © 1984.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate social perceptions of a man who impregnated a woman and advised her to have an abortion, and those of a woman who had an abortion. Each subject rated one of four persons on a social distance measure: either a man involved in an abortion, a woman having had an abortion, a male control target, or a female control target. Both abortion targets were perceived less favorably than the control targets. The female abortion target was rejected more by male subjects than by female subjects, and the male abortion target was more rejected by females than by males. While holding permissive attitudes toward abortion was related to willingness to meet the female abortion target, restrictive attitudes toward abortion predicted willingness to meet the male abortion target. Variables related to stigmatization of the man were lack of identification, restrictive attitudes toward abortion, and perceived responsibility. Restrictive attitudes toward women's rights and roles in this society and restrictive attitudes toward abortion predicted stigmatization of the woman. It is suggested that shifting one's attention from characteristics of the stigmatized to observers' characteristics provides a useful perspective on the stigmatization process. © 1984.},

The results indicated that virtually no man or woman denied having sexual fantasies. Any observable sex differences were in kind rather than amount of fantasy. Women had more submission fantasies, whereas men reported more performance fantasies. This difference was interpreted as reflecting social sexual stereotypes. In support of a cognitive skill model, it was found that sexual fantasizing proliferates along with increases in both sexual and daydreaming experience. Sexual passivity was related to a greater degree of fantasizing during sex. On the whole, the findings suggest that sexual fantasizing is a universal occurrence which in itself is not necessarily related to psychopathology. © 1984.},

Sex-role orientation was influential only for male subjects. For males paired with males, femininity was positively related to intimacy and length of the self-disclosure and the expected intimacy of the partner's disclosure. Masculinity was negatively related to intimacy of disclosure of males to male partners. Femininity was also positively related to males' ratings of expected disclosure intimacy for female partners. Androgyny, assessed using the M × F interaction, was unrelated to self-disclosure for all pairs. However, sex-typed or cross-sex-typed males expected more intimate disclosures from male partners. These data provide a test of the impact of sex-role orientation on a behavioral measure of self-disclosure and contradict previous studies using self-report measures of self-disclosure which find a positive relationship between masculinity and intimacy of disclosure. © 1984.},

Ross' (1980, Human inference: Strategies and shortcomings of social judgment, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall) analysis of informational vividness offers an attractive conceptual framework that identifies and predicts the effects of several types of information that have been confounded with other variables in fear appeal studies. Thus, the first purpose of this factorial experiment was to investigate the persuasive impact of three types of vivid information frequently used in fear appeals: emotional interest, concreteness, and proximity. It was predicted that vivid information would be more persuasive than pallid information. The results disclosed that emotionally interesting information was highly effective in changing intentions to seek protection from the depicted health threat. Also, the impact of information of high emotional interest and greater temporal and spatial proximity was enhanced with the passage of time, but information of low emotional interest and proximity diminished over time. Additional findings indicated that concrete, specific information was memorable and affected beliefs. The data rejected the hypothesis that memorial availability mediated the effects of vivid information. Implications for designing and strengthening fear appeals were discussed. © 1984.},

Type A's and B's were given an initial stake of $4 and provided the opportunity to invest some or all of that amount for the chance to win an additional $2. Investment occurred as a function of time, with subjects believing they would win the additional $2 if a counter reached a randomly determined number. Each unit increment on the counter also resulted in the loss of 1¢ from the initial stake, thus as the counter progressed, goal attainment became more certain, but expenses also increased. Subjects could stop the counter at any time and keep the remainder of their initial stake or continue to invest until the initial stake was depleted (the counter was programmed to never hit the "jackpot"). Half of the subjects could monitor the counter directly, while the other half could not and had to rely on their subjective time estimates. Results indicated that when objective time passage cues were present, Type A's and B's did not differ in their investment decisions. When subjects had to estimate time passage, however, Type A's invested far more than Type B's. These results indicate that under appropriate conditions, Type A's are more susceptible than Type B's to psychological entrapment. © 1984.},

Interactions between self-other perspective and anxiety reached significance for the stability and globality dimensions as well as for affect. These interactions supported the major hypothesis that self-other biases in causal attribution, typically reported in the social psychological literature which are favorable to the self, are absent or reversed in situations which are problematic for socially anxious individuals. The main effect of perspective was modified by the above interactions and indicated that the typical self-other bias was demonstrated but only in the low-anxious group. The expectancy variable showed only main effects of perspective and, anxiety. Higher anxious groups had higher expectancies for the occurrence of the negative events. Expectancies were higher for others than for the self. There were no significant main effects or interactions for the causal dimensions of locus and control. A general implication of the present data is that adequate adjustment may require attributionaJ sets which enhance one's sense of competency relative to others. Furthermore, attribution-based approaches to counseling may need to focus on a network of causal ascriptions and specifically address self-other discrepancies in perceptions of causality. © 1984.},

Issues of substantive and structural validity were addressed by considering item content, test format, homogeneity of items, and the factor structure of items.

Construct validity was supported further by a pattern of theoretically meaningful correlations with the Personality Research Form (D. N. Jackson, 1974, Goshen, NY: Research Psychologists Press).

Personality trait scales of different lengths were assembled for this study in order to represent features of the construct and empirical methods of selection. It was observed that (a) although reliability and validity generally increased with test length, aggregation beyond a certain point can fail to be expedient; and (b) although the prediction performance of empirically derived measures initially surpassed that of construct based assessments, the superiority of the empirical scales did not generalize to trait criteria that were not used as a basis for item selection. The data are interpreted as providing support for a theory-based program of test development where substantive considerations involving item content play a major role.

Ninety-one 6- to 10-year-old children and 100 undergraduates rated the desirability of a set of outcomes which systematically varied with regard to the benefits to themselves and another person. Theoretically specified characteristics of the outcomes were then used to generate a regression equation predicting the desirability ratings separately for each individual. These regression equations were then clustered into groups of individuals who used decision rules characteristic of the major social values. The results indicate that the 8- to 10-year-old children, compared to the 6- to 7-year olds, more often expressed a social value involving equality and tended to less often express a social value involving superiority. Comparison of the social values expressed by the children and adults indicated that the adults more often expressed group-enhancement and individualism social values and less often expressed a social value involving superiority. © 1984.},

  abstract = {In a recent article, H. D. Day, D. Marshall, B. Hamilton, and J. Christy (1983, Journal of Research in Personality, 17, 97-109) have reported on a series of simulation studies designed to investigate properties of various coefficients of behavior stability as applied to cross-situational data. The results of their research have prompted them to suggest precautions regarding the measurement of behavioral regularity with conventional indices of response consistency. A critical review of their paper reveals aspects of the data, procedures, and interpretations of Day et al. (1983) which undermine many of their conclusions. Notable problems include (a) inappropriate comparisons of internal consistency reliability coefficients based on nonparallel analyses, (b) anomalous data which may be due to errors of rounding or recording, and (c) the failure to recognize certain assumptions underlying reliability estimation. More importantly, it is shown that the investigation of Day et al. (1983) represents primarily an empirical verification of several measurement principles for which algebraic proofs are amply documented. © 1984.},

Neither Study 1 nor 2 found a relation between private or public self-awareness and negative affect. However, attention to private self-aspects was generally more positive and less ruminative for low as opposed to high private self-conscious subjects, and awareness of oneself as a social object was generally more positive but less important for low as opposed to high public self-conscious subjects. What may have accounted for the negative relation between private self-consciousness and average affect was that low private self-conscious subjects were more likely to attend to their private self-aspects if they were pleasant than if they were unpleasant, while high private self-conscious subjects' degree of private self-awareness was unrelated to whether the content of this state was pleasant or not. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that low private self-conscious individuals engage in a more selective type of self-attention when in the private self-aware state than do high private self-conscious individuals. Regarding the relation between self-awareness and social context, both studies found that the presence of others results in a heightened public self-awareness. However, even though subjects were more attentive to public self-aspects when with others than when alone, in general, they were more attentive to their "private self" than to their "public self". Results are discussed in terms of current self-awareness theory. © 1984.},

In a third experiment, the effect of attending to physical sensations on the back of the hand was found to have a similar facilitating effect and was seen as resulting from the allocation of attention to internally generated stimuli. In a final experiment, attending to feelings and to the physical sensations on the back of the hand was found to increase speed of mental addition.

In a companion study examining these manipulations in verbal memory, self-reference study tasks produced the best word recognition, with no difference due to the emotionality of nonself tasks. These results suggest emotionality and self-awareness have different effects on facial and verbal memory.

Despite empirical support for the independence of some dimensions, some researchers have employed a single score on a multidimensional measure of trait anxiety, summed from the dimension scale scores, as a singular measure of generalized trait anxiety. This violates the theoretical underpinnings of the approach. This study examined whether a total score on a multidimensional measure of trait anxiety could supplement the ability of individual dimension scale scores in predicting state anxiety responses to dimension-congruent stress. Thirty-two female college students who scored at differing levels of dimensional and general anxiety were required to perform two laboratory stress tasks under conditions of stress representing different dimensions of trait anxiety. The results provide support for a multidimensional approach to general trait anxiety but indicate some value of a total score in supplementing predictions based on individual scale scores. The data provide a cautionary note that a total score on a multidimensional measure is of little value unless full consideration is given to the profile of dimension scale scores. © 1983.},

In the first study, a multidimensional scaling analysis was performed on 16 ecologically valid person prototypes elicited within a student subculture. Four dimensions (academic performance, extroversion, social status, and radicalism) were found to define the prototype space. The cultural salience of these 16 person prototypes was empirically determined, indicating a close relationship between independently rated salience and the dispersion of prototypes in the prototype space. In the second study prototype-consistent vs inconsistent, and high vs low cultural salient character descriptions were created, and subjects' (a) free recall memory, (b) predictions, (c) impression formation, and (d) confidence ratings about these targets were assessed. Results showed the superior processing of prototype-consistent information for high-salient, and prototype-inconsistent information for low-salient characters. The results are interpreted as suggesting that multiple information-processing strategies are used in person perception, with normative and cultural variables playing a decisive influence in selectively triggering such processes. © 1983.},

In both sets of studies, the aggregate stability coefficient was a strictly increasing function of the number of aggregated trials, and even trivial amounts of score stability resulted in large stability coefficients. In a third series of studies, high stability coefficients occurred when computed on combined unstable subsamples which differed from each other only in central tendency. Terminal aggregate coefficients were compared with Spearman-Brown prophecy and Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients computed on the experimental data. It was concluded that the method of aggregation produces spuriously high estimates of behavioral consistency. It was further shown that the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula and coefficient alpha accurately predict the results of the aggregation method, suggesting that aggregation is an internal consistency reliability procedure.

The results were inconsistent with viewing rape as primarily caused by sexual frustration or sexual maladjustment, since sexuality variables were generally not predictive of LF or LR. In contrast, a variety of rape-supportive attitudes and beliefs such as blaming the victim for her rape or viewing sexual violence as sexually arousing to women were successful predictors of both LF and LR. These data were interpreted as supporting theories of rape which consider cultural, socially transmitted attitudes about women and rape to be psychological releasers for sexual aggression.

The results of the first study supported a dispositional explanation of jealousy (i.e., substantial person and situational variance). In addition, a sizable interaction effect was revealed. Study 2 examined the nature of this interaction for sexual jealousy. Jealousy situations were broken down by distinguishing between the event, characteristics of the partner, and the relationship as separate components of the situation. Seventy-one female respondents indicated their perception of threat and their degree of upset when considering the same hypothetical jealousy-evoking events with three different partners. A substantial person component was found. In addition, responses to the jealousy-evoking events were found to vary as a function of which partner was being considered. The second study demonstrated that aspects of the relationship (i.e., relative involvement) were more important than personality characteristics of the partner in determining this intrasubject variability in the intensity of jealous rections. © 1983.},

Men and women (total N = 368) opted to perform either skill or chance versions of masculine and feminine tasks, and then provided ratings of performance expectancy, importance of success, and perceptions of task characteristics. Results support the conclusion that men do not prefer skill and women chance as had been found previously, but rather that while men's skill preferences are higher than women's on a masculine taks, women prefer skill more than do men on a feminine task. Skill-chance preferences were primarily a function of the expectancy of success on skill tasks. © 1983.},

Blatt (Psychoanalytic Study of the Child, 1974, 29, 107-157) distinguished between two types of depressive experiences, one characterized by strong dependency needs and the other by self-criticism and guilt. This paper reports a series of validation studies of the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ), which was developed to measure individuals' vulnerabilities to these types of experiences (S. J. Blatt, J. P. D'Afflitti, & D. M. Quinlan, Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 1976, 85, 383-389). The Dependency and Self-Criticism scales were shown to be stable in the face of both a 13-week interval and the receipt of midterm grades. Dependency was associated with conflict concerning the expression of hostility and, in males, feelings of helplessness. Self-Criticism was associated with low self-esteem and high levels of morality-conscience guilt. In a study of behavior in dyadic problem-solving tasks, Dependency in males was found to be negatively related to task leadership, and Self-Criticism in females tended to be negatively related to judged likeability. On the other hand, little support was found for the hypotheses that Dependency would be related to field dependent cognitive style and to the use of primitive defense mechanisms. The results were viewed as supporting the utility of Blatt's distinction between the two types of depression, but a number of anomalous findings indicated a need for further study of the DEQ. The question of the developmental level of the two types of depression, possible sex differences in the correlates of the scales, and the possibility of situational specificity in individuals' responses were identified as the areas most in need of study. © 1983.},

This appears to be true whether the standards are internal (such as attitudes or values) or external (e.g., norms). There is some question, however, as to what happens in situations in which an important personal standard conflicts with a salient external standard. Research by E. Diener and T. K. Srull (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1979, 37, 413-423) has suggested that under such circumstances the social standard is likely to predominate. However, there is reason to believe that the standards employed in their study may not have been very salient nor very important to the subjects. In the present experiment, subjects with either conservative or liberal sexual attitudes were exposed to information suggesting a prevailing norm of sexual liberalism. They were then asked to respond to a number of sexual and nonsexual attitude measures while their attention was or was not self-directed by means of a mirror. Primary results indicated that self-awareness enhanced conformity to the social standard (as in Diener & Srull, 1979) for the conservative subjects; however, correlational analyses within the self-focused and non-self-focused conditions indicated that self-aware subjects did not "abandon" their personal standards when responding to the conformity pressure. Instead, their responses tended to be more in line with their previously expressed attitudes than did the responses of the non-self-focused group. Results are discussed in terms of the effects of self-awareness on reactions to potent, but conflicting behavioral standards. © 1983.},

The present conceptual replication failed entirely to produce the Cherry et al. finding; indeed, the present data show a tendency for responsiveness to demand characteristics only among subjects responding via "paper and pencil." This finding is consistent with the traditional conceptualization of the bogus pipeline procedures and supports the meaningfulness of data obtained using the technique within the impression management literature. Interestingly, social desirability did not enter in any way into the effects; this fact raises some intriguing questions about the social desirability construct itself. © 1983.},

Male and female subjects read scenarios depicting an accident in which the harmdoer either admitted or did not admit responsibility (Experiment 1) or expressed various degrees of remorsefulness (Experiment 3). Both investigations indicated that a show of remorse or of a remorseful gesture (i.e., assuming responsibility) can partially vindicate harmdoers by requiring them to make fewer reparations to a victim (Experiment 1) or pay less of a fine (Experiment 3) among females only. Thus psychological damages incurred in a wrongful act can serve as a "down payment" toward restoring justice. In corroboration with these findings of sex differences, Experiment 2 revealed that females consider to a greater extent than males reasons such as a harmdoer's feelings when assigning a fine. © 1983.},

Scores are uncorrelated with social desirability, moderately correlated with I-E control and belief in a just world, and more highly correlated with authoritarianism.

Overall, subjects classified as prosecution biased were more conviction prone and adopted a less stringent standard of reasonable doubt. In a second study, community jurors watched one of two videotaped mock trials in a courtroom. Prosecution-biased subjects asserted a higher probability that the defendent committed the crime and rendered a higher percentage of guilty verdicts than defense-biased subjects for one of the two trials.

It was hypothesized that both negative and positive feelings would increase helpful reactions. In the case of negative moods, however, helpfulness would be inhibited if the induced affect engenders self-reflection by associating the bad mood with the person's self-image in a self-referencing process. To test these predictions, female undergraduates read mood-inducing statements that were either (a) negative in content and containing the personal pronoun "I", (b) negative but not self-referencing, (c) emotionally positive in content, (d) emotionally neutral, or (e) no statements. Afterward, they were asked to complete a questionnaire and to volunteer to participate in a future study. Findings in the first experiment confirmed the hypothesis. Women who had read negative, self-referencing statements were the least likely to comply with a helpful request. The most helpful participants were those who had previously recited the negative, but not self-referencing, and the positive statements. Neutral and control subjects displayed intermediate amounts of compliance with the helping request. Questionnaire results showed that self-reflection was responsible for decreasing the helpfulness of women when negative mood was associated with some aspect of the self. A second experiment successfully replicated the major findings of the pilot studies and the first experiment. © 1982.},

  abstract = {Persons' classifications of emotions are viewed as based on an implicit taxonomy of emotions. This implicit taxonomy has sometimes been thought of as a bipolar dimensional system within which are located all the various emotion-descriptive categories (fear, anger, happiness, etc.). A dimensional taxonomy of this kind assumes that all emotion categories are interrelated in a systematic way. More often, however, the implicit taxonomy has been thought of as a list of separate emotions. A taxonomy in the form of a list typically presupposes that emotion categories are either synonymous, independent, or mutually exclusive. McNair, Lorr, and Droppleman's Profile of Mood States (San Diego: Educational and Industrial Testing Service, 1971) is one such list of emotion categories and was therefore examined in two studies for the actual interrelationships among its categories. To examine intraindividual relationships, 45 subjects rated the emotional state posed in each of 32 videotape segments. Even at the level of the individual subject, results showed that emotion categories are systematically interrelated and can be accounted for reasonably well by a system of three bipolar dimensions: pleasure-displeasure, arousal-sleepiness, and dominance-submissiveness. Evidence for the same bipolar system was also obtained in a second study, which examined interindividual differences in the self-reported emotional states of 343 subjects. © 1982.},

The second test, which ostensibly measured the same abilities, was an insolvable design problem that is commonly used to measure persistence. Feedback concerning prior outcomes had a direct influence on expectancies for the second task, but persistence on that task was a joint function of feedback and self-consciousness. That is, favorable feedback led to greater persistence than did unfavorable feedback, but only among subjects high in self-consciousness.

Sixty undergraduate students were divided into three equal groups.

The subjects in the first two groups were asked to reduce the anxiety reaction of a confederate, as shown on an oscilloscope, by talking to him. The anxiety waves were shown on the oscilloscope and were preprogrammed so that subjects in the uncontrollability treatment group experienced lack of control over the results, while the ones in the controllability group were led to belive that they successfully controlled the changes of the confederate's anxiety. Then, half of the subjects in each of the three groups received positive feedback on their personality, while the other half received no feedback. In the last phase all subjects participated in a word recognition task using a tachistoscope operated by a combined push-button and microphone device. Response latency, number of correct identifications, and persistence in the task were recorded. In addition, the subjects completed a mood scale. The results indicate that subjects who received induced self-esteem treatment showed significantly more deficit reversal as reflected in response latency, persistence, feelings of potency, and sadness. The results are discussed in relation to (a) the assumption regarding the similarities between learned helplessness and depression, and (b) the usefulness of induced self-esteem as a form of treatment for helplessness depression. © 1982.},

Women with high or low amounts of life stress were given failure feedback, no failure feedback, or a cognitive coping strategy (affective isolation) in addition to failure feedback. Failure feedback increased self-reported anger and anxiety immediately following feedback and also after a follow-up test and decreased expectations about performance for the second test. Affective isolation significantly reduced anger and anxiety but failed to affect expectations. Women with high amounts of life stress reported significantly less anxiety than women with low amounts of life stress in response to failure feedback. These results were interpreted within C. D. Spielberger's (in C. D. Spielberger & R. Diaz-Guerrero (Eds.), Cross-cultural anxiety, New York: Wiley, 1976) cognitive model. It was proposed that differing levels of previous life stress cause people to make varying judgments about the degree of threat in a short-term stressful situation. Persons with high amounts of life stress may not be aroused in response to short-term stress because they perceive the short-term stress as only a "drop in the bucket" compared to the other events which they have experienced. © 1982.},

  abstract = {Personality-ability relationships in old age were examined in 71 elderly persons. Two modes of assessment were used. One consisted of measuring intellectual abilities (17 tests) and personality (6 dimensions) by means of established instruments. Intellectual abilities covered were drawn from Horn and Cattell's model of psychometric intelligence. Personality dimensions included three measures of locus of control and one measure each for achievement motivation, anxiety, and morale. The second mode of assessment was aimed directly at the interface between cognitive abilities and personality. Six such interface (context-specific) scales, involving self-assessment and attributions dealing with intellectual functioning in the context of aging, were developed using the six traditional (transcontextual) personality scales as conceptual criteria. These newly developed interface scales exhibit satisfactory convergent and discriminant validity with their transcontextual parent scales of personality. The six parent personality measures and the six personality-ability interface scales were correlated, separately, with performance scores of psychometric intelligence. Relationships between the two domains (personality, ability) were substantial and of greater magnitude when personality was assessed in the context of the personality-ability interface. Because of the conjoint anchoring of the interface scales to both personality and ability, the findings provide a basis for beginning to clarify the nature of personality-ability relationships in old age. In addition, the results support the continuation of a measurement approach to the study of interdomain relationships that includes the use of direct assessments of the domain interface, in addition to traditionally distinct measures of different domains. © 1982.},

The first experiment concerned the effects of empathic anxiety, sociopathy, and perceived similarity/dissimilarity to a distressed person on helping. As predicted, subjects who experienced high levels of empathic anxiety helped more than subjects who experienced low levels of empathic anxiety. High sociopathic subjects experienced lower levels of empathic anxiety and helped less than did low sociopathic subjects. However, a path analysis disclosed that sociopathy's relationship to helping was not due to (or mediated by) empathic anxiety. The similarity manipulation did not influence empathic anxiety or helping. In the second experiment, subjects were classified as primary or secondary sociopaths (based on their levels of trait anxiety). As in the first experiment, empathic anxiety and sociopathy were significantly related to helping. Primary sociopaths displayed less empathic anxiety than secondary sociopaths, but the two groups did not differ in their willingness to help. Thus, in neither study could the sociopath's behavior be explained by empathic anxiety. The discussion concerned empathy as a mediational variable in helping and the role of personality variables in helping. A post hoc explanation of the sociopath's behavior, based on Schwartz' theory of the characteristics of helpers, was proposed. © 1982.},

These data suggest that both short forms, though based on different construction methodologies, share the same underlying personality attributes. Future research is suggested to replicate these results and extend them to the full MMPI. © 1982.},

Leventhal's "parallel response model" (in Advances in experimental social psychology, L. Berkowitz (Ed.), New York: Academic Press, 1970, Vol. 5) predicts that low-esteem subjects will show deficits in both competency and coping behaviors. Experiment 1 manipulated threat level of a tetanus communication. Low-esteem subjects showed coping deficits on measures of free associations, free recall, fatalism, and coping. Threat groups differed only on fear and danger measures. Experiment 2 manipulated the fear level of an antismoking film and used false feedback to alter perceived competency. Positive feedback increased perceived competency to quit smoking among low-esteem subjects only. Without feedback, low-esteem subjects reduced smoking less than high-esteem subjects; positive feedback reversed the pattern. The discussion argued that, consistent with Leventhal's model, the low-esteem coping deficit has two independent causes: (1) excessive concern with fear, and (2) inadequate perceived competency. © 1982.},

Factorial validity for the use of these measures was obtained from a factor analysis which uncovered a general factor of socialization, while evidence for convergent validity was derived from the relationship between these scales and teacher ratings of refractory behavior. Scores from the Child Nowicki-Strickland Internal-External Scale were found to predict undersocialization in the expected direction. Several possible interpretations of this relationship were suggested and a biosocial explanation was advanced to account for the possible simultaneous development of both externality and undersocialization. © 1982.},

Three determinants-central tendency, ability, and social desirabliity-offer a reasonable account of the observed implicational relations. First, persons with a given disposition are not expected to emit behavior that is widely discrepant with that disposition. Second, ability considerations dictate that persons with skillful dispositions are believed capable of unskillful behavior, but unskillful persons are thought relatively incapable of skillful behavior. Third, persons are believed to more frequently attempt socially desirable than socially undesirable behavior. Also, persons with moderate dispositions are believed to actually emit socially desirable behavior more frequently than socially undesirable behavior. Finally, the determinants noted above may be of differing relevance for morality, ability, and preference attributes. © 1982.},

Second, it was proposed that when people are faced with uncertainty regarding the occurrence of a highly desirable outcome, they tend to underestimate the likelihood of its occurrence, in an attempt to avoid future disappointment. These hypotheses were tested within the context of a lottery in which subjects were given a low, moderate, or high chance of winning a prize that was either high or low in attractiveness.

  abstract = {Entrapping conflicts are those in which individuals continue to invest their resources-even in seemingly losing propositions-in large part to justify previous unfilled expenditures. It has been demonstrated that individuals define their motivation for investing very differently at the various stages of an entrapping conflict. One implication of this motivational dynamic is that various factors may differentially affect degree of entrapment (i.e., amount invested), depending upon the point in time at which they are introduced. The present studies were designed to test this notion. All subjects were given an initial monetary stake and had the opportunity to win more by taking part in an entrapping investment situation. In Experiment 1, half the subjects were provided with a payoff chart that made salient the costs associated with investing (Highcost salience condition) whereas half were not (Low-cost salience condition). Moreover, for half of the subjects the payoff chart was introduced before they were asked to invest (Early condition) whereas for the other half it was introduced after they had invested a considerable portion of their resources (Late condition). Entrapment was lower in the High salience-Early than in the Low salience-Early condition. However, there was no difference between groups in the Late condition. In Experiment 2, the perceived presence of an audience interacted with personality variables related to face-saving to effect entrapment. When the audience was described as "experts in decision making," subjects high in public self-consciousness (or social anxiety) became less entrapped than those low on these dimensions. When the audience consisted of individuals who "wished simply to observe the experimental procedure," however, high public self-consciousness (or social anxiety) individuals were significantly more entrapped than lows. Moreover, these interaction effects occurred when the audience was introduced late, but not early, into the entrapment situation. Taken together, these (and other) findings suggest that economic factors are more influential determinants of behavior in the earlier stages of an entrapping conflict, whereas face-saving variables are more potent in the later phases. Alternative explanations are discussed. © 1982.},

They then worked on 16 tasks, and were interrupted on 8 but were allowed to complete 8. Finally, an unexpected free-recall test of task solutions was administered. Only subjects low in self-esteem exhibited the selective recall pattern. It was hypothesized that in a formal situation, interrupted activities were viewed as failures. It was assumed that the recall of failures was particularly threatening to low-self-esteem subjects, resulting in selective forgetting or selective storage of solutions. It was also found that all subjects recalled solutions from completed tasks more frequently than solutions from interrupted tasks. Several interpretations for the latter phenomenon were suggested, including a dual mechanism involving both motivation persistence and motivation reduction, and the incorporation of information into a self-referent schema. © 1981.},

Strangers, friends, mothers, and fathers of stimulus persons also rated them on extraversion and anxiety. The results indicated that: For judgments of anxiety there was lower interjudge consistency for high than for low self-monitoring stimulus subjects. For judgments of extraversion there was no difference in interjudge consistency for low and high self-monitoring stimulus subjects. The results also showed that anxiety was a more "private" trait in that intimates' but not strangers' judgments correlated with stimulus subjects' self-reported anxiety (r = .50 and r = .11, respectively), while extraversion was a more "public" trait in that both intimates' and strangers' judgments correlated with stimulus subjects' self-reported extraversion (r = .42 and r = .51, respectively).

Experiment 1 was concerned with whether the reciprocal imitation effect is really reciprocal or if the subsequent imitation will generalize to someone else. It was found that adult subjects who were previously imitated at the 75% rate on a perceptual judgments task subsequently imitated their partner more, rated their partner more attractive, and felt more confidence when imitated than did subjects imitated at the 25% rate. These results were obtained regardless of which confederate the subjects imitated, thus indicating that reciprocal imitation is not necessarily reciprocal, but is generalizable. Experiment 2 assessed whether the subsequent imitation is the product of the effects of being imitated or is the result of the subject observing the imitator's imitation. The results indicated that after having observed imitation at a 75% rate, adult onlookers are more likely to subsequently imitate and be attracted to the imitator, the imitated person, and a person new to the situation than are onlookers who observed a 25% imitation rate. A theoretical modification is advanced which holds that subsequent imitation effects, whether from observing others imitate or from being the target of the imitation, result from a process of imitation of imitativeness. The results of these two experiments have implications for theory in imitation and social learning. © 1981.},

Results showed that the rationale for the study was correct because state anxiety was indeed negatively related to backward digit span performance as previous research had shown, but the offer of reward did not elevate state anxiety scores and, more importantly, the offer of reward led to a significant improvement in backward digit span performance-an effect which is the opposite of what would be predicted by the anxiety hypothesis.

  abstract = {Meehan, Woll, and Abbott (Journal of Research in Personality, 1979, 13, 25-38) have shown that scores on Hogan's Survey of Ethical Attitudes (SEA) are affected by instructions to simulate politically liberal or conservative attitudes. They also found that scores are affected by instructions to present one's self in a socially desirable or undesirable light, and that group ratings of the social desirability of the items could account for as much as 78% of the item response variance. Meehan et al. argue from these data that the SEA is a measure of political attitudes rather that moral judgments, and that the SEA is susceptible to dissimulation in the form of role playing and impression management. The present paper argues that test-taking is a form of self-presentation, identical to what goes on in everyday social interaction; this renders the Meehan et al. findings meaningful rather than problematic. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relationship between personality testing, self-presentation, moral judgments, and political attitudes. © 1981.},

Gender differences in attitudes toward rape were also prevalent throughout the factor structure of beliefs which was found. Male subjects also rated their own likelihood of raping, "if they could be certain they would not be caught". The results of a discriminant analysis indicated that high scorers on this self-rating showed a pattern of disinhibitory beliefs about the normality and acceptability of rape, and the seductiveness of rape victims. High self-rated likelihood of raping among males also correlated negatively with scores on the femininity scale of the BSRI. © 1981.},

Some of these subjects had signed up to participate in a study ostensibly focusing on movie ratings. They were randomly assigned to view, on two different evenings, either violent-sexual or control feature-length films. These movies were viewed in theaters on campus and two of the movies (i.e., one experimental and one control) were being shown as part of the regular campus film program. Members of the classes from which subjects had been recruited but who had not signed up for the experiment were also used as a comparison group. The dependent measures were scales assessing acceptance of interpersonal violence against women, acceptance of rape myths, and beliefs in adversarial sexual relations. These scales were embedded within many other items on a Sexual Attitude Survey administered to all students in classes several days after some of them (i.e., those who signed up for the experiment) had been exposed to the movies. Subjects were not aware that there was any relationship between this survey and the viewing of the movies. The results indicated that exposure to the films portraying violent sexuality increased male subjects' acceptance of interpersonal violence against women. A similar nonsignificant trend was found on acceptance of rape myths. For females, there were nonsignificant tendencies in the opposite direction, with women exposed to the violent-sexual films tending to be less accepting of interpersonal violence and of rape myths than control subjects. Explanation of the data on the basis of "attitude polarization" and "reactance" effects are discussed. Also discussed are the conditions of the present research in terms of the type of stimuli used, the "dosage levels" of exposure, and the duration of effects in relation to future research and a general social climate promoting a sexist ideology. © 1981.},

In a 2 × 2 × 2 completely crossed factorial experiment, male undergraduates were initially either angered or not by an experimental accomplice. When later given the ostensible opportunity to administer shocks to the same accomplice in a typical Buss procedure, the subjects were either told that longer and more intense shocks would probably interfere with the person's learning as well as causing him more pain (hurt instructions) or given no information about the effects of shocks on learning (standard instructions). Finally, after each shock they administered, the subjects were provided with either high or low victim pain feedback. The angered men were significantly more aggressive than their nonangered counterparts, and a significant interaction between anger and instructions indicated this was especially true for the men given hurt instructions. Significant interactions between the other independent variables and trial blocks revealed that the angered men, particularly those receiving hurt instructions and high victim pain feedback, displayed the greates increases in aggression. The results provide qualified support for the derived proposition about hostile aggression that signs and/or knowledge of victim injury and pain can stimulate more intense aggression from angry individuals. © 1981.},

Subjects were 180 undergraduate students enrolled in introductory psychology courses. Although females reported higher levels of anxiety on all four scales than did males, a discriminant function analysis indicated that math anxiety was the strongest contributor to the separation of the sexes. Significant score differences as a function of sex role were found using the STAI A-Trait scale, and a significant sex × sex-role interaction was found for scores on the S-R Inventory of Anxiousness. Feminine-typed males and undifferentiated females reported highest anxiety levels in comparison to same-sex individuals.

As predicted, members of high functional similarity dyads evidenced greater attraction to one another than did members of low functional similarity dyads. Experiment II investigated the relationship of functional similarity to level of acquaintance (i.e., friends, nominals) and type of assessment (i.e., physical, interactional, psychological) in a 2 × 3 factorial design. As hypothesized, "friendship" pairs of male undergraduates displayed greater functional similarity than did "nominal" pairs from the same population, particularly at the deeper level of "psychological" assessment.

The present study extended the habituation paradigm used in some previous work to include an examination of differences between extraverts and introverts during and following long-term overhabituation. Electrodermal activity was recorded while 72 extraverts and 72 introverts were subjected to criterion auditory habituation to a 1000-Hz, 90-db tone, followed by 60, 100, or 140 trials of overhabituation. The overhabituation run was followed by a test stimulus of 7000 Hz and a final repetition of the standard stimulus. Results showed that introverts increased in response frequency with increasing overhabituation exposure, while extraverts showed an increase only from 100 to 140 trials. In addition, the hypothesis that differences in test response amplitude favoring introverts would be eliminated by extended overhabituation training was supported. Specifically, extraverts showed increased responses at 100 and 140 trials, while introverts remained approximately constant across the three conditions. Finally, results supported the Sokolov hypothesis that overhabituation training produces test responses of larger amplitude. © 1981.},

Results indicated that Type A's performed better on math problems and recalled more fatigue-related mood items when the task was important than when it was trivial; for Type B subjects, there was no difference in the number of math problems solved correctly or number of mood items recalled between important and trivial task conditions. Moreover, Type A's reported greater fatigue when mood recall was the important task than when math was the important task, whereas fatigue ratings of Type B's did not differ across these conditions.

However, the nonverbal-disapproval summary category demonstrated weak validity. Eye contact had the most complex, unexpected contextual meanings. Reduced eye contact appeared to variously convey disapproval, cues of lower interpersonal power, and a reduction of intimacy to compensate for accompanying increases in other approval behaviors.

  abstract = {Rational and statistical techniques for controlling social desirability (SD) in scales derived from self-report inventories are reviewed. The principal-factor deletion technique is explained in detail. It is applied during factor analysis when derived content scales are expected to be tainted with SD. If one principal factor is found to represent social desirability, the implicated factor is dropped and the communalities adjusted before the remaining factors are rotated to a desired simple structure criterion. Subscales derived from resulting factors are free of SD bias. Principal-factor deletion is compared with other approaches including rational techniques, covariate procedures, and target rotation. © 1981.},

On the other hand, improvements in physical fitness were not related to reported improvements in abilities and confidence. These findings are of interest because they indicate that some of the important personal changes that are associated with physical fitness training are not due to changes in fitness, but appear to be due to other factors (e.g., group participation and expectancies). © 1981.},

  abstract = {Many investigators have demonstrated that task-contingent extrinsic incentives can reduce an individual's interest in some intrinsically rewarding task. Although it has been widely assumed that this "undermining effect" is mediated by the individual's causal attributions for engaging in the task, there has been little independent verification of this notion. In the present study subjects were asked to perform an inherently interesting problem-solving task. Half of the subjects were told that they could earn money by solving the task successfully (Money condition), whereas the other half were not (Control condition). Consistent with previous research, Money condition subjects expressed less liking for the task. In addition, Many condition participants attributed their task performance to less internal causes. Furthermore, across conditions, subjects who attributed their behavior to less internal causes were less apt to enjoy the task. The present data, therefore, more convincingly implicate the mediating role of causal attributions in the relationship between extrinsic rewards and intrinsic interest. Alternative explanations are discussed. © 1981.},

In addition, they participated in a forced-interaction task with a confederate, from which ratings of anxiety and effectiveness were obtained. A two-step principal-components procedure was used in order to control method variance. Substantial cross-domain convergence was found in three of the four second-order components, two of which (Social Competence and Impulse Expression vs Control) clearly represented dimensions of interpersonal behavior. Strong support was found for the validity of several PRF components as well as of other instruments used as measures of constructs. Results suggest that the purported failure of trait constructs in accounting for behavioral variance may be more the result of methodological factors than of theoretical inadequacy. © 1981.},

Moreover, the Bem index was found to be based on the best available combination of orthogonal interpersonal scales for measuring sex-role stereotypy. In this recent sample of college students, the hypothesis that Bem's index of androgyny reflects the more general construct of interpersonal flexibility was confirmed for both male and female subjects. The recognition that Bem's index of androgyny is specific to the interpersonal domain should encourage others to develop androgyny indices in other domains such as temperatment, interests, and cognitive styles. © 1981.},

The group averaging strategy generally used to describe event-mood correlations was compared to a tabulation of significant individual correlations.

Wives' ratings of their husbands' mood revealed the same relationship with experiences as did husbands' self-rated mood. Differences in the populations studied and the event and mood assessments between our study and Rehm's could account for this finding.

Despite enhanced autonomic reactivity, those in the first study who were led to believe that the tones would be extremely disturbing subsequently rated them as less disturbing than did their counterparts who were given comparatively benign expectations. The signal-detection analysis of heart rate and skin conductance suggested enhanced “preparedness of response” among the high-threat subjects; given the diminished subjective ratings, increased response readiness at the autonomic level may have reflected physiological activity assuaging subjective aversiveness of the tones. Contrary to the first study, the psychometrically designated threatened group in the second experiment produced both greater autonomic reactivity along with elevated subjective ratings of disturbance. The SDT analysis provided evidence of greater autonomic sensitivity to noxious stimulus properties. Results were discussed in terms of their implications for theories of anxiety; the comparative utilites of signal-detection theory and conventional methods of autonomic-response scoring were elaborated. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

Frequency data confirmed an earlier study of the same population in finding that, during sexual activity, males think more about past sexual experiences and ongoing behavior, while females think more about imaginary experiences. Effects data indicated that these frequency differences occur because females use fantasy more than males to increase arousal, to decrease anxiety about sexual activity, to compensate for less-than-ideal sexual experience, and to enhance even a satisfactory experience. Males, in contrast, use thoughts of real experience more often than females to increase arousal and to control and direct sexual activity. © 1980, All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that people are more likely to attribute a stranger's behavior to external causes if that behavior is common in a given population than if it is relatively unique (the consensus rule). It was proposed in the present paper that another and perhaps simpler rule is available for causal attributions for an acquaintance's behavior, such that more external attributions are made as the behavior becomes increasingly inconsistent with extant impressions of the target (the goodness-of-fit rule). It was found that the goodness-of-fitrule, but not the consensus rule, was used in the attribution of causality for acquaintances when the behavior could be made to fit with extant impressions. When the behavior was completely inconsistent with extant impressions, both consensus and goodness-of-fit rules were used, such that the most external attributions were made in the poor fit/high consensus condition. © 1980.},

  abstract = {Subjects made three ratings for each of 30 words, then had an unannounced immediate free recall test and a second test after 1 week. There was no evidence to indicate significantly better retention on either test when the dimensions rated were unrelated as opposed to related. Subjects low on test anxiety performed better overall than subjects who scored high on either the emotionality or worry components of test anxiety. On the delayed test, the test anxiety effect was apparent only when study ratings involved unrelated dimensions (i.e., broad encoding). This interaction is consistent with two conclusions. First, rating related dimensions led to narrow encodings, thus hindering low-anxiety subjects who normally encode broadly. Second, even explicit ratings of unrelated dimensions did not induce high-anxiety subjects to encode more broadly. That the high-anxiety deficit was not overcome even with explicit orienting tasks may indicate inflexibility in deploying memory strategies. © 1980.},

In Experiment 1, subjects exposed to a persuasive communication that was either low or high in coerciveness rated the degree of coercive intent behind the communication. Type As perceived greater coerciveness overall than Type Bs, a finding that was most reliable in the low coercion condition. In Experiment 2, subjects' postcommunication opinions were assessed, so that resistance to persuasion could be measured. A gender difference within Pattern A emerged from this study. Male Type As resisted the persuasion attempt to an equivalent degree whether it was low or high in coerciveness; female Type As displayed comparable resistance in the low coercion condition, but tended to be even more resistant in the high coercion condition. In contrast, both male and female Type Bs displayed persuasion in the low coercion condition, and resisted (to a degree comparable to Type As) in the high coercion condition. Experiment 3 further investigated resistance to persuasion among females, using a different issue for the persuasion attempt. Type A women again resisted more in the high coercion than the low coercion condition. Type B women displayed no evidence of resistance in either condition. Discussion centers on the observed gender difference and the possible theoretical importance of the notion that Type As perceive threat at lower objective levels than do Type Bs. © 1980.},

Evanston, Ill.: Row, Peterson, 1957) theory of cognitive dissonance has not been consistently demonstrated. In previous studies, this failure can be attributed to design deficiencies, and other related problems. The present study manipulated dissonance by having subjects write a counterattitudinal essay under conditions of high or low choice. Information in the form of pamphlets and discussion groups was offered to the subjects such that they could choose information that was consonant and dissonant with the decision to write the essay. The information was offered either before or after an attitude measure on the essay topic, as the attitude measure could also be a source of dissonance reduction. The results indicate that the high choice manipulation yielded greater attitude change than the low-choice manipulation. High-choice subjects desired consonant information more and dissonant information less than did low-choice subjects. This effect was found for both measures of information desire (pamphlets and discussion groups). Low-choice subjects who received the attitude questionnaire before the information measures wanted information more than if offered the information before the attitude questionnaire, implying a sensitizing effect produced by the attitude questionnaire for the low-choice subjects. The various effects are discussed as providing support for predictions from Festinger's dissonance theory. © 1980.},

Since the plausibility of the misattribution manipulation appears to be the central problem, the present study attempted to increase plausibility by manipulating familiarity with the setting and actual psychological arousal in a clinically relevant situation. Subjects only slightly fearful of giving speeches presented a speech in front of two observers. Familiarity was varied by having half of the subjects give a pretest speech, while arousal was manipulated by having half of the subjects ingest caffeine while the others ingested a placebo just prior to the test speech. The subjects' attributions were varied by giving them either arousal or irrelevant symptom instructions regarding the effects of the ingested drug. Direct suggestion rather than misattribution effects occurred: Those subjects receiving arousal symptoms reported more nervousness than subjects who had received irrelevant symptoms.

The explanation Seligman and Maier give for these findings is critically analyzed and found to be unsupported at several critical points. The "patchwork" nature of the theory and observations is considered and it is contended that what is new in learned helplessness research is a schedule-shift effect like that observed when extinction follows partial reinforcement. A schedule-shift discrimination theory of "learned helplessness" effects is offered which is closely parallel to a widely accepted explanation of other schedule-shift effects, notably the partial reinforcement extinction effect. Although the behavioral effects of some schedule shifts resemble clinical depression, the latter is a more complex behavioral phenomena than the former which in turn has broader relevance to human behavior than just depression. © 1980.},

The job of the subject-experimenters was to "offer information" on every third trials as the subjects attempted to solve the task. It was hypothesized that the expectancies of the subject-experimenters would be communicated to the subjects via periodic comments, that these expectancies would differentially affect the subjects' performance on the task, and that prior experience on a similar task would differentially affect subjects' performances on the task. The results demonstrated that the expectancies instilled in the subject-experimenters were communicated and influenced the performances of subjects as predicted.

Males and females were first exposed to either a sadomasochistic or a nonviolent version of the same sexual passage and then to a portrayal of rape. Responses to the rape showed interactions between gender and previous exposure: In comparison to males who had read the nonviolent version, males exposed to the sadomasochistic story were more sexually aroused to the rape depiction and more punitive toward the rapist whereas females evidenced differences in the opposite direction. Simple effects analyses for each gender, however, yielded significant differences for the punitiveness measure only and for males only. In addressing the second hypothesis, gender differences were found in the perception of rape. Third, the assertion that rape may be an extension of normal sexual patterns was explored. Subjects were found to believe that a high percentage of men would rape if assured of not being punished and that a substantial percentage of women would enjoy being victimized. While both genders shared these beliefs, very few women believed that they personally would derive pleasure from victimization. Surprisingly, more than half of the males indicated some likelihood that they themselves would rape if assured of not being punished. The association between this self-report and general attitudes toward rape revealed a pattern that bears striking similarity to the callous attitudes often held by convicted rapists. © 1980.},

Forty-eight male and forty-eight female subjects played 100 trials of the prisoner's dilemma game with a confederate who played either a 74% cooperative or 74% competitive predetermined strategy and then filled out the Interpersonal Judgment Scale rating the confederate. Behaviorally similar confederates received more positive evaluations than dissimilar confederates supporting the social comparison hypothesis. Further, the strategy of the confederate did not influence choice behavior in mixed-sex dyads, suggesting that sex roles may inhibit behaviorally based male-female interaction. The generality of previous gaming research which has dealt almost exclusively with same-sex dyads is called into question. © 1980.},

The defensive (DE)-congruent (CE) external distinction was strongly confirmed in both cases. In Experiment 1, DEs assumed less personal responsibility for failure than for success, while CEs assumed little personal responsibility for either outcome. Defensive externals performed more poorly than CEs on a task described as an IQ test, suggesting greater anxiety in the face of possible failure. In Experiment 2, DEs rated themselves more favorably and derogated evaluator's competence more than CEs following receipt of negative information regarding their interpersonal skills. Congruent internals (CI) performed more poorly than defensive internals (DI) on the "IQ" task, while male DIs attributed responsibility for outcomes more defensively. It was suggested that a consistently internal view of causation may increase stress in evaluative situations. Implications of these findings for better understanding the relationship between locus of control and maladjustment were discussed, and suggestions for future research were presented. © 1980.},

  abstract = {Objective tests of personality typically include a number of items or trials; the total score on the test is the sum of the subject's "correct" responses across all such trials. Normally, the trials are varied systematically across various facets of the test design, so that the total score represents a composite measure of accuracy averaged across these test facets. However, since only one score is computed for each subject, some potentially important kinds of individual differences-namely all those associated with each particular variation in the test design-are treated solely as measurement unreliability. Such a psychometric stance may serve to obscure more differentiated types of individual differences, with the result that composite scores from trials based on one type of experimental design may not be highly related to such scores from trials using a somewhat different design. The present paper presents a general procedure for scoring objective tests more analytically. To illustrate this general rationale, and to demonstrate its potential utility, data have been reanalyzed from two previous studies, one using the Rod-and-Frame test, the other the Müller-Lyer illusion. In both cases, the traditional global accuracy score did not correlate significantly with other theoretically related variables, while a number of component scores were quite highly related. © 1979.},

In the high memory load condition, there was a decline in performance for low FA subjects on both inference and recognition. Other aspects of the results suggested that the breakdown in information processing, for low FA subjects in the high memory load condition, occurred during or shortly after initial encoding of the sentences. © 1979.},

Listener, as a group, were significantly better than chance in accurately judging veracity (p < .001). In addition, a set of personological variables (social intelligence, field dependence/independence, number of siblings, TV viewing habits, and confidence in judgments) was identified that accounted for 22% of the variance in accuracy (p < .0002).

Recognition memory performance revealed very strong memory for context. Furthermore, when recognition memory performance for stimuli encountered before final error in concept identification was correlated with trial of last error on the concept identification task, the correlation was positive and significant. Thus, context memory seemed to impede the abstraction process significantly. Task strategy differences were not highly correlated with performance on EFT, V, and Q.

Subjects were then given the opportunity to select normative comparison information in order to evaluate their performance.

A review of previous conflict studies led to the conclusions that two different procedures are used to produce conflict and that a single-gradient model should be used when conflict is produced by the punishment of an approach response, while the two-gradient model developed in the present experiments should be used when conflicts are produced by the simultaneous arousal of independently established approach and avoidance tendencies. © 1979.},

Attraction was found to increase with the desirability of the disclosed information, but the magnitude of this effect was contingent on the information's intimacy and on the elicitation of beliefs about the other person. When beliefs were elicited prior to the measurement of attraction, intimate information had a stronger effect on beliefs and attitudes than had superficial information. However, when beliefs were elicited after the evaluative judgments had been made, intimate information attenuated the effects of positive and negative self-disclosures. These findings are discussed in the framework of a "perceived attributes model" which stipulates that attraction is a function of beliefs about the other person. Consistent with this model, an estimate of attraction based on the beliefs elicited was found to be highly correlated with standard attraction measures. Unlike earlier studies, no evidence was found for self-disclosure reciprocity. © 1979.},

It follows from these theoretical assumptions that anxiety will have differential effects on performance efficiency (i.e., the quality of performance) and on processing effectiveness (i.e., performance efficiency/effort). Anxiety will always reduce processing effectiveness, but will not impair performance efficiency if there is sufficient effort expenditure.

A second experiment found incidental memory for trait adjectives was equally enhanced by judging each directly in reference to one's self-concept or indirectly by retrieving an episode either from one's life or from one's mother's life. Contrariwise, memory was poorer when traits were judged in reference to a less familiar person. Thus, good memory depends on relating the inputs to a well-differentiated memory structure. © 1979.},

  abstract = {Critics of Kinesthetic Aftereffect (KAE) recommend abandoning it as a personality measure largely because of poor test-retest reliability. Although no test can be valid if lacking true reliability, to discard a measure because of poor retest reliability is an oversimplification of validation procedures. This pitfall is exemplified here by a reexamination of KAE. KAE scores involve measures before (pretest) and after (test) aftereffect induction. Internal analysis of a KAE study showed: Differential bias is present; its locus is the second session pretest; its form makes second-session pretest scores functionally more similar to first- and second-session test scores and functionally more dissimilar to first-session pretest scores. Given this second session bias, the retest correlation tells us nothing about the true reliability of a one-session KAE score. However, if a measure possesses external validity, it must to some degree show true reliability. Based upon a literature review of one-session KAE validity studies, we conclude that one-session KAE scores are valid and hence show true reliability. KAE remains a promising personality measure. © 1978.},

Subsequently, subjects were given the opportunity to be directly aggressive by actually setting the shocks themselves. During this phase a new target who was nonprovocative was introduced. Subjects aggressed alone, in the presence of their partner, or in the presence of a new person. Results revealed that noncooperation reduced the level of instigative aggression and carried over to the second phase of the experiment. Subjects who had had cooperative partners were more aggressive toward the new target than were subjects who had had noncooperative partners. The presence or absence of the partner was not significant. © 1978.},

After the learning task the subjects made a number of ratings, including how much they had enjoyed this first session. On the second day, all subjects were simply required to administer shocks to a different person for his mistakes on the same learning task. The angered subjects were more punitive on both days toward both learners than the nonangered men. On the first day the angered men also increased the intensity of the shocks they delivered over trial blocks. Most interestingly, the angered men showed more enjoyment of the first session of the experiment as their victim's pain increased, and this enjoyment rating was related to the angered subjects' level of aggression on the second day of the experiment when they punished an "innocent" victim. The results were interpreted as consistent with the hypothesized reinforcement process which essentially states that signs and/or knowledge of the victim's suffering can reinforce impulsive or angry aggressive behavior. © 1978.},

The two specially attending groups exhibited greater galvanic skin-response conditioning during the anticipatory period than the other groups.

The External-attending Group exhibited reliably greater anticipatory deceleration of heart rate than the Internal-attending Group, while the Internal-attending Group exhibited reliably more nonspecific electrodermal responses than the External-attending Group.

Mere predictability of noise offset did not have the same effect. Subjects who could control the noise did not differ from those who heard no noise with respect to the duration of shocks given. Noise had no effect on shock duration among nonattacked subjects. In a follow-up study subjects who were given bogus information that they were aroused by noise were less punitive toward an attacking confederate than subjects given no such information.

Self-reports of maximal dominance tended to outpredict self-reports of typical dominance for both typical and maximal laboratory expressions of dominance. In addition, maximal self-reports were of equal predictive validity for both those subjects reporting themselves as consistent in expressing dominance and those reporting themselves as inconsistent (situationally variable). Finally, the extent to which subjects were self-reflective (private self-consciousness) and concerned about their appearance to others (public self-consciousness) mediated the validity of both their typical and maximal self-reports, although the predictive superiority of maximal self-reports was maintained. © 1978.},

Unrestricted maximum likelihood factor analyses of the RAM scales revealed four primary factors for each version. Since the first two factors from both analyses resembled measures of Hope of Success and Fear of Failure, two strategies for improving the scales were adopted, both of which eliminated the items loading on factors III and IV. One strategy involved adding the indexes of Hope of Success and Fear of Failure, while the other involved finding their difference. Construct validity coefficients were computed for the 26-item full scales, and the RAM measures formed using the above strategies with student grade point average and TAQ scores as the criterion variables. In Experiment 2, the appropriate RAM scale and the TAQ were administered to 30 males and 38 females. Construct validity coefficients were computed in this cross validation sample with the three RAM measures as predictors and with TAQ scores and student achievement in a course in Social/Personality Psychology as the criterion variables. The three RAM measures were used to predict the performance of 16 males who worked at a common laboratory task (anagrams) in Experiment 3. The results of all three experiments indicate the Hope of Success minus Fear of Failure measure to be the best measure of RAM from a theoretical, psychometric, and pragmatic point of view. © 1978.},

For the seven dimensions rated by the subjects, four dimensions showed the predicted effect. The other three dimensions, which did not show the effect, were the only ones that showed a significant effect due to the face itself.

There were no differences between the two groups following a simple paired-associate task, both groups showing a similar increase with increased SI. Finally, SCL was higher for introverts than extraverts during tones preceded by a rest period, and this was especially true for the early trials and for lower SI (75 and 83 dB compared with 100 and 103 dB). Taken together, these results suggest that SCL is higher for extraverts at higher levels of arousal but that the reverse is true for lower levels of arousal. This relationship is consistent with the theory that introverts have a "weak nervous system" which develops transmarginal or protective inhibition under stress. © 1977.},

The participants were led to expect a bias in the game equipment, such that one player would have an advantage and the other a disadvantage. All participants recorded levels of aspiration both before and after being informed of the alleged bias. Upon completion of the game, the subjects made ratings of causal attribution to five factors: ability, task difficulty, effort, luck, and equipment bias. The results showed that the students with the putative disadvantage set significantly lower aspiration levels and performed at a significantly lower level than those students with the supposed advantage. Thus the putative bias became a real bias, although a psychological rather than a physical one. It is suggested that the source of the bias and the performance differences was a self-fulfilling prophecy. In contrast to the results of earlier studies, there were no meaningful differences in ratings of causal attribution. © 1977.},

In an analysis on subsequent aggression toward the confederate, it was found that female subjects reduced their aggression after exposure to low arousing humor while maintaining aggression at a high level for high arousing stimuli.

  abstract = {The experiment investigated the effects of the mode and patterning of rehearsal on the acquisition and retention of modeled activities varying in organizational complexity. Subjects observed a filmed model construct two configurations, containing high or low organizational requirements. Immediately after exposure they rehearsed the modeled activities either mentally, motorically, mentally and then motorically, motorically and then mentally, or engaged in a distracting activity that prevented rehearsal of what they had see. Performance tests were conducted immediately after the rehearsal phase and again 1 week later. Subjects who rehearsed the modeled behaviors symbolically, whether singly or in conjunction with motor practice, reproduced both configurations more accurately than those who rehearsed motorically or not at all. Motor rehearsal increased speed on the organizationally simple task, but did not enhance response acquisition over and above observation alone. The overall results are interpreted as supporting the social learning view that modeled behaviors are best acquired when demonstrated activities are first organized symbolically and then refined on the basis of performance feedback. © 1976.},

Race by sex interactions are largest when socioeconomic class is controlled and are highly related to the size of the main effect of sex as well. White boys and girls differ more than black boys and girls whether the overall sex difference favors males or females. Sex by grade and, to a lesser extent, sex by area interactions were also moderately large and consistent with the size of the main effect of sex. Since there are no consistent relationships with other main effects, and since the measures producing sex differences also tend to produce the interactions, it is concluded that sex differences and the interactions with sex share the same causes. Differences between these results and those of Jensen are also discussed. © 1976.},

In support of the main hypothesis, the second experiment showed that extraverts changed their attitudes less than introverts as a result of writing an essay which was counter to their own attitude under conditions where they had high perceived freedom of choice. © 1976.},

  abstract = {Using a 2 × 2 analysis of variance design, effects of dogmatism and field dependence on subjects' awareness of demand characteristics in a verbal operant conditioning experiment were investigated. From 103 introductory psychology students who participated in a replication of an earlier verbal conditioning experiment, 92 were randomly selected for final study. It was found that only subjects aware of the purpose of the conditioning study appeared to "condition". Subject awareness was assessed by a series of converging questions which were independently content analyzed by two judges and coded to yield a total awareness score. Based on earlier research it was expected that dogmatism and field dependence would interact to affect levels of awareness. The two-way interaction was statistically significant (p < .05) as predicted. The results were discussed in terms of speculations regarding the modes of perceptual functioning involved in perceiving demand cues. © 1976.},

The hypothesis was tested and confirmed that cognitively complex judges were more likely than simple judges to perceive and evaluate similarity/dissimilarity in others.

While the bulk of the significant correlations were low, accounting for approximately 5-10% of the variance, the general trend of the results suggest that women's preferences for male physiques can be summarized in terms of feminine and masculine sex-role stereotypes. Women who are traditionally feminine show a preference for traditionally masculine physiques, i.e., tapering V physiques, while less traditional women express more nonstereotyped preferences.

On the free-recall task, low arousal subjects were found to cluster words together on the basis of semantic category at a higher rate than high arousal subjects. These results were taken to support the view that high arousal (as indexed by personality measures) leads to a focus on the physical aspects of verbal material, whereas low arousal leads to a memory organized around semantic aspects.

Subjects were provided with opportunities to behave punitively under diffused or personalized responsibility toward groups that were characterized in either humanized, neutral, or dehumanized terms. Both dehumanization and lessened personal responsibility enhanced aggressiveness, with dehumanization serving as the more potent disinhibitor. Escalation of aggression under conditions of dehumanization was especially marked when punitiveness was dysfunctional in effecting desired changes. The uniformly low level of aggression directed toward humanized groups, regardless of variations in responsibility and instrumentality of the conduct, attested to the power of humanization to counteract punitiveness. Results of supplementary measures are consistent with the postulated relationship between self-disinhibiting processes and punitiveness. Dehumanization fostered self-absolving justifications that were in turn associated with increased punitiveness. Findings on the internal concomitants of behavior performed under different levels of responsibility suggest that reducing personal responsibility heightens aggressiveness more through social than personal sources of disinhibition. © 1975.},

A stressful segment was also dichotically scored as to whether the point of looking was on or off dominant elements of the scene. Results indicated that Repressors and Sensitizers had equivalent levels of perceptual scanning (and both significantly higher than Intermediates' level) independent of film segment content, but that they differed in on/off and average point of looking for the stressful segment such that Repressors were avoiding stressful content.

Under conditions of no provocation, no significant differences in aggressiveness were observed between nonathletes and athletes, nor between noncontact- and contact-sport athletes. In contrast, under conditions of provocation, nonathletes displayed more aggressiveness than athletes. Non-contact-sport athletes behaved significantly less aggressively than both nonathletes and contact-sport athletes. Contact-sport athletes failed to behave significantly less aggressively than nonathletes, however. The findings were explained as the result of an acquired superior ability in athletes to cope with provocation under competitive circumstances, which is partially counteracted in contact-sport athletes by their aggressiveness habits and disinhibition training. © 1974.},

When clarified, implications for predicting social behaviors from personality variables were derived. Two types of behavioral criterion were delineated, and it was argued that personality measures should be systematically related to multiple act criteria, but not necessarily to single act criteria. It was suggested that behaviors could be treated as items on a behavioral measure of personality and that standard scaling criteria be applied in identifying behaviors that should be related to a given trait dimension. In attempting to identify behaviors which are linearly related to a personality trait, the application of Bayes theorem was shown to be of theoretical interest. Two indices, a validity index and a linearity index, were derived from Bayes theorem and it was shown that validity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for linearity. © 1974.},

Attitudes toward the depicted candidates were assessed in a postexperimental questionnaire. Neither degree of brutality nor affect toward the victim exerted a significant main effect, but a significant transverse interaction between the two variables was observed. When the assault involved minimal levels of brutality, the victimization of a rejected candidate was appreciated significantly more than that of a favored one; when intermediate levels of brutality were depicted, assaults against rejected candidates did not differ appreciably from attacks upon favored candidates in the level of mirth they elicited; when the brutality was extreme, aggression against rejected candidates was appreciated less than assaults against favored candidates, although nonsignificantly so. Of the various theoretical notions which were advanced to predict the results, a rationale involving the decoder's motivation to favor or object to the manner in which the aggressive agent is characterized as well as his motivation to enjoy or dislike the communication's projected outcome was considered to account best for the findings. © 1974.},

The model accurately predicted PL on the basis of beliefs about X (the attribute to which information about O directly pertained); this accuracy was greater than that obtained in an earlier study in which real persons were evaluated, and did not depend upon the favorableness of X. However, predictions of PL based upon beliefs about O's intelligence overestimated obtained values, while predictions based upon beliefs about O's sarcasm underestimated these values; moreover, PI and PS were underestimated and overestimated, respectively, by beliefs about X. It was speculated that these discrepancies were due to temporary inconsistencies among beliefs resulting from the information presented which did not have time to be resolved before beliefs were reported. Changes in PL, PI, and PS resulting from additional information about X were accurately predicted in all cases.

The results suggest that in a large number of instances item responses communicate information which is in agreement with what was known about the patients form other sources of information. The content of item responses was consistent with interpretations from several empirical measures of the Ss' test performance. © 1974.},

It was hypothesized that attraction is also highly related to affective changes induced in subjects by interpersonal stimuli associated with a stranger. Byrne and Rhamey's (1965) experiment was replicated with one change: subjects' affective states were assessed at the beginning of the session and immediately prior to the subjects' evaluation of a stranger. Four levels of attitude similarity (1.00, .67, .33, and .00) and three types of evaluation conditions (positive, negative,and control) were employed in a 4 × 3 factorial design, with 19 subjects per cell. As hypothesized, attraction was found to be highly related to subjects' affective states and affective changes induced by attraction stimuli (p < .001). © 1974.},

Measures of anxiety were obtained before, during, and immediately after Ss gave a speech (ego-stressor) and blew up a balloon until it burst (physical stressor). While exposure to each stressor resulted in dramatic changes in A-State, it was found that differential A-State increases for the high and low speech trait anxious Ss occurred only during the ego-stressor condition. These findings were discussed in terms of Trait-State Anxiety Theory with particular reference to the differential stressful effects of ego and physical stressor on A-State for Ss who differ in A-Trait. © 1973.},

  abstract = {An experiment was conducted to assess the effects of actual racial membership versus similarity of beliefs about racial issues on interpersonal evaluations. Prejudiced and unprejudiced White male students observed a videotaped interaction of two Black and two White male actors discussing racial issues and then evaluated the actors on several scales. One White and one Black actor took a conservative stand on racial issues, and the other White and Black pair of actors took a liberal position. Results from the ratings showed strong belief prejudice effects. Prejudiced subjects were attracted to conservative actors while unprejudiced subjects were attracted to liberal actors. Additionally, there were two kinds of race effects. Prejudiced subjects preferred White to Black actors, but unprejudiced subjects showed a reverse bias, preferring Black to White actors. A tentative explanation for this unusual finding was proposed. © 1973.},

Evidence was also presented that a mediator between activity type and density preference is whether the presence of other people facilitates or inhibits the individual's goals in the setting. Personality factors also influence density preferences: Close standing Ss preferred a high to a low density setting; far standing Ss showed an opposite preference pattern, but only in the party condition. Correlations between Ss' personal space scores and several background and personality variables are also presented. © 1973.},

  abstract = {Under conditions of both minimal and extreme initial provocation, the effect of exposure to neutral vs aggressive films on subsequent aggressive behavior was assessed relative to a no-exposure condition. Excitatory changes were also recorded. Under minimal provocation, communication conditions were found to have no differential effect on aggressive behavior. Under extreme provocation, relative to the no-exposure condition the neutral film significantly reduced subsequent aggression, whereas the aggressive film reduced it to an insignificant degree only. The excitatory changes observed in the extreme-provocation conditions coincided with these differences in aggressive behavior. The findings, obviously countercathartic, were interpreted as inconsistent with the proposition that filmed aggression elicits aggressive behavior. Bandura's reasoning on attentional shift was modified to account for the data. An alternative explanation was developed from considerations of the aggression-modifying effect of residual excitation. © 1974.},

Support was obtained for both of these predictions. Findings were discussed in terms of their implications for the prevention and control of human violence in naturalistic social situations. © 1973.},

High intensity attack resulted in high intensity counterattack and negative ratings of the opponent. Low intensity attack resulted in low intensity counterattack and relatively positive ratings for the opponent. Decreasing attack resulted in decreasing counterattack and positive ratings of the opponent. Increasing attack resulted in increasing counterattack and comparatively high aggression ratings of the opponent. © 1973.},

  issn = {00926566},
  abstract = {197 subjects judged the perceived presence or absence of ability or effort, given information about task outcome (success or failure), the difficulty of the task (easy, intermediate, or difficult), and the state of the complementary cause (effort or ability). The data revealed that a multiple sufficient causal schema is used to explain common events. That is, the presence of ability or effort is perceived as enough to produce success at an easy task, while the absence of ability or effort is perceived as sufficient to result in failure at a difficult task. On the other hand, a multiple necessary schema tends to be employed to explain uncommon events. Success at a difficult task is believed to require both ability and effort, while failure at an easy task tends to be perceived as caused by low ability and low effort. In addition, there were disparities in the causal judgments for success and failure: failure outcomes are more likely to elicit a multiple sufficient schema. Further, in achievement-related contexts ability and effort are perceived as negatively covarying causal determinants of typical successes and failures. In addition to supporting hypotheses from attribution theory, the data shed further light upon the perceived determinants of success and failure, and demonstrate the influence of cognitive structures on achievement-related causal judgments. © 1974.},

A computer-based acoustic analysis of the four tapes showed that paralinguistic confidence was expressed by increased loudness of voice, rapid rate of speech, and infrequent, short pauses. Under some conditions, higher pitch levels and greater pitch and energy fluctuations in the voice were related to paralinguistic confidence. In a 2 × 2 design, observers perceived and used these cues to attribute confidence and related personality traits to the speaker. Both text and voice cues are related to confidence ratings; in addition, the two types of cue are related to differing personality attributes. © 1973.},
