We utilized social exchange theory to examine the effects that supervisor developmental feedback has on employee loyalty toward the supervisor. The 337 participants for our study were recruited from a large manufacturing enterprise in Hunan, China. Using hierarchical linear regression analysis, we found that supervisor developmental feedback was positively related to both trust in, and employee loyalty toward, the supervisor. Trust was not only positively associated with employee loyalty toward the supervisor but also partially mediated the relationship between supervisor developmental feedback and employee loyalty toward the supervisor. Further, interactional justice moderated the positive relationship between supervisor developmental feedback and employee trust of the supervisor, such that the strength of this relationship was enhanced as interactional justice increased. Managerial implications and directions for further research are discussed.},

We applied mood-as-information theory to investigate the effect of negative mood on prohibitive and promotive employee voice, and the moderating role of transformational and transactional leadership styles in this relationship. We recruited a paired employee-supervisor sample, comprising 48 supervisors who rated their employees' promotive and prohibitive voice, and 224 employees who completed measures of negative affect and their supervisors' transformational and transactional leadership. Our results showed that negative mood enhanced prohibitive voice but reduced promotive voice. Further, transformational leadership weakened the effect of negative mood on voice, whereas transactional leadership reinforced this effect. The research results provide a solid theoretical basis for managers to manage their negative mood by changing their leadership behavior, and provide a new perspective for leaders to develop employee management strategies, and develop an objective and impartial evaluation system based on the intuitive external behaviors of employees.},

Results showed that the effect size of empowerment on commitment in sports organization was high. We identified meaningfulness, competence, impact, and self-determination as subfactors of empowerment. Employee commitment was derived from affective, normative, continuance, cognitive, and behavioral commitment types. Results showed that empowerment significantly affected commitment to the sports organization. Consequently, the findings provide a useful rationale for Korean sports organizations to apply empowerment and organizational commitment to enhance their organizational performance.},

We found that acute alcohol consumption had a main effect on the PAP for speed of action to inflict pain. Our results also showed that thwarted interpersonal needs and acute alcohol consumption had an interaction effect on the RAP but not on PAP pain tolerance. The combination of thwarted interpersonal needs and acute alcohol consumption increased pain tolerance and alcohol induced participants' behavioral impulsivity, potentially leading them to enact self-aggressive behavior by increasing their ability to inflict harm on themselves and facilitating acting out behavior.},

We used a multilevel research design and collected data at the organizational and individual levels from a sample of 485 employees of 32 companies in Guangdong Province, China. We used Amos 17.0 and hierarchical linear modeling 6.08 software to examine our hypotheses and the theoretical model. Results showed that organizational identification fully mediated the relationship between HPWS and employees' job performance as well as that between HPWS and their turnover intention. Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between firm-level human resource management and individual-level employee outcomes, and highlight the importance of considering the implementation of HPWS practices to strengthen employees' identification with the organization and improve their performance.},

The latent class dimensions of parental involvement in home-based education were parent-child communication, home supervision, homework help, emotional support, and parental expectations. A series of models were estimated specifying one through five latent classes. Four types of home-based parental involvement were identified: supportive, basic, strict, and disengaged. After determining the best fitting model, we tested our hypotheses with multiple analysis of variance of parents' socioeconomic status and the students' academic achievement by type of home-based parental involvement. There were, accordingly, significant differences for both socioeconomic status and their children's academic achievement. Scores for both achievement and socioeconomic status were highest among students with supportive home-based parent involvement, followed by those with basic, strict, and disengaged involvement, in descending order. The quantity and quality of parental involvement positively related to the children's academic achievement.

Results of structural equation modeling showed that organization-technology fit differed based organizational support but not the technological characteristics of ESNs; task-technology fit was influenced by ESN technological features, task features, and organization-technology fit; and there were significant relationships between organization-technology fit and perceived usefulness, between perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, and between task-technology fit and perceived ease of use. The research findings contribute to understanding of the roles of organization-technology-human fit constructs that drive people's perception of usefulness in the context of ESNs.},

Using cross-case analysis with a survey of a large sample drawn from recently established high-technology entrepreneurial teams in China, we explored the interaction mechanism effect of the teams’ internal and external networking behavior on their creativity. Results showed that external networking behavior (such as maintaining business connections, expanding external social interaction, and participating in external professional activities) and internal networking behavior (such as increasing internal transparency) generate a positive influence on entrepreneurial teams’ creativity. Further, this influence is boosted by an interactive effect between the external and internal networking behavior of the entrepreneurial teams.

Reflected self-efficacy, defined as one’s perception of how others assess one’s ability to perform a task, may be a meaningful predictor of creative performance over and above self-assessed self-efficacy. We examined if reflected self-efficacy, compared to self-assessed selfefficacy, is a more meaningful predictor of creative performance. A sample of 141 Master of Business Administration students completed measures of self-efficacy, reflected self-efficacy, proactive social management, team trust, and creative performance. Results showed that reflected self-efficacy had superior incremental validity compared to self-assessed self-efficacy, and that reflected self-efficacy affected individual creativity via the mediator of proactive social engagement. This relationship was more pronounced when a focal team member’s trust toward the team was low (vs. high). Our findings support the importance of the functions of social aspects of self-efficacy in enhancing individual creativity.},

We examined factors affecting psychological distress in non-Hispanic White (n = 9,170) and Asian American (n = 1,417) older adults, using 2015–2016 California Health Interview Survey data. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that disability, poor/fair health, and neighborhood environmental factors, such as unsafe neighborhoods and low social cohesion, were significantly associated with psychological distress in both ethnic groups. People aged between 65 and 69 years, women, nonhomeowners, and those living at less than 200% of the federal poverty level had increased odds of psychological distress among the non-Hispanic Whites. For Asian Americans, physical inactivity was associated with an increased rate of psychological distress. These findings indicate that multiple risk factors increase the probability of psychological distress in older adults. Further, important similarities and differences exist between older Asian Americans and non-Hispanic Whites, which have implications in screening and development of interventions for these ethnic groups.},

We then selected stereotype labels of the actor’s behavior that were consistent or inconsistent with the behavior, and which were activated either supraliminally or subliminally. The results showed that whether a stereotype was activated supraliminally or subliminally, the influence on spontaneous inferences was the same. Specifically, when the stereotype was inconsistent with the actor’s behavior, spontaneous situational inferences were facilitated, and when the stereotype was consistent with the actor’s behavior, spontaneous trait inferences were not facilitated. As Chinese people may be more prone to spontaneous (vs. trait) inferences, this indicates that human inferences are deeply influenced by culture.},

In this study we examined whether the shifting function can be modulated by intergroup threat, and if so, how this works. We conducted 2 experiments, using a task-switching paradigm, the results of which provide converging evidence that intergroup threat can impair the shifting function. Results showed that participants in the threat condition in each study (Study 1 symbolic threat: N = 29; Study 2 realistic threat: N = 29) experienced greater shifting costs than did those in the control condition (Study 1: N = 29; Study 2: N = 28). Further, group identification moderated the depletion effect in the intergroup threat condition, with participants closer (vs. less close) in group identification showing greater switching costs following the intergroup threat intervention. In sum, these results suggest that intergroup threat could deplete switching ability, and this effect could be influenced by group identification. In future studies researchers should investigate more kinds of intergroup threat than those we used in this study to assess the generalizability of our findings.},

In this study we applied structural equation modeling, and data were collected from 286 Taiwanese consumers. The results suggest that green packaging design is a strong predictor of green trust, which enhances green brand attachment. Moreover, green trust is an effective mediator between green packaging design and green brand attachment.

Moral foundations theory is claimed to be universally applicable and is classified into 5 foundations of morality: Care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, respect/subversion, and purity/degradation. This theory has not been tested in the Eastern cultural context. Therefore, in this study I addressed this lack in the context of China, where there are people of a number of different ethnicities. I adopted the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, which was completed by 761 Chinese of Han, Uygur, and Tibetan ethnicity. The results show that there was no gender difference in morality foundation scores, but the differences among ethnic groups were significant: Tibetans scored lower than did Han and Uygur in care and fairness, and Uygur scored higher than Han and Tibetans did in loyalty, respect, and purity. The interactions between gender and ethnic group were significant for care, fairness, and respect. These findings suggest that moral foundations theory is applicable to China, that the Moral Foundations Questionnaire can also be partially applied to Chinese, and that ethnicity is an influential factor when people make moral judgments.},

Responses to the recordings indicated that a speaker with a male voice was rated as significantly less conscientious, agreeable, extraverted, and open to experience than was the same speaker with a female voice. Regarding social behavior, there was a tendency for the speaker with a male voice to be rated as more hostile than was the same speaker with a female voice.

Our results showed that people paid more attention to the future (vs. the present) when their perception of economic mobility was high; this, in turn, promoted more favorable reactions toward potential (vs. achievement). Thus, we suggested circumstances under which highlighting a person’s potential for future success is effective and those when it is not effective.

Researchers have introduced the prosocial rule breaking (PSRB) concept to explain situations where employees encounter an ethical dilemma between promoting the welfare of the organization and following organizational regulations. PSRB can be regarded as ethical decision making in an organization, but few researchers have used ethical decision theories to study it. Adopting the moral licensing perspective, we argued that organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), the typical form of moral conduct within organizations, would predict PSRB, and that this relationship would be mediated by moral selfimage and moderated by intrinsic motivation for OCB. Results of our 2-wave survey of 433 Chinese employees showed that employees’ OCB had a positive effect on PSRB through the mediator of moral self-image. Additionally, when intrinsic motivation toward OCB was high, the relationship between OCB and moral self-image was amplified and gave more confidence to employees to practice PSRB. Our findings contribute to the understanding of PSRB and moral licensing theory.},

We used structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses, and found that entrepreneurial leadership was negatively related to turnover intention through the fully mediating roles of work-to-family conflict and affective commitment in serial order. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Although anger tends to lead to aggressive behavior, the underlying processes that moderate this relationship are largely unknown. Our aim with this study was to explore the relationship between adolescents’ online anger and cyber aggression and the moderating effect of seeking online social support. Participants were 509 Chinese adolescents who completed anonymous questionnaires about seeking social support, online anger, and online aggression. Cyber aggression had a significant negative correlation with seeking social support and a significant positive correlation with online anger. This direct association between online anger and cyber aggression was moderated by seeking social support online, such that the positive relationship between online anger and cyber aggression was significant only among adolescents low in seeking online social support. These results suggest that seeking online social support can mitigate cyber aggression among adolescents in the context of mild online anger.},

The N450 effect is characterized by topography and negative polarity of an incongruent minus congruent difference potential, and the SP effect has positive polarity (incongruent minus congruent difference potential). Positive and negative body language examples were obtained from pupils in an actual school context, and emotional words were selected. Compound stimuli were presented, each comprising a congruent or incongruent word displayed across a body image. Event-related potentials were recorded while participants judged body expression valence. Reaction times were longer and accuracies were lower for the incongruent compared to the congruent condition. The N450 component amplitude in the incongruent condition was more negative than in the congruent condition. Results showed a behavioral interference effect and an N450 effect for trainee teachers in this context, thus indicating that the body–word task was efficient in assessing emotional conflict in an educational context, and trainee teachers’ perception of body expressions of students could be influenced by emotional signals.

Mothers (8 from Shanghai, 8 from Taiwan) participated in a 12-week intervention of a weekly counseling session. At the end, analysis of transcripts of the mothers’ speech showed that the frequency of positive emotional words increased and negative emotional words decreased, and their scores on the Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory decreased significantly. Children also showed a significant reduction in scores on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale. These results demonstrate that counseling via a semistructured group intervention can improve mothers’ parenting and coping skills, and help to alleviate their children’s autism symptoms.},

We investigated 156 entrepreneurial TMTs of new ventures in China’s Optical Valley, and found that: (a) the entrepreneurial TMT’s extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience all have a positive impact on a new venture’s performance, but neuroticism did not; (b) Knowledge integration had a partial mediating effect on the relationship between the TMT’s extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience and the performance of the venture; (c) A transformational leadership style of entrepreneurial TMT leaders was found to significantly moderate the relationship between the TMT’s extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness to experience and the new venture’s performance. The findings not only contribute to theories of entrepreneurial TMT, team personality composition, and knowledge management, but also have practical significance for improving the performance of new ventures.},

This proposition was supported by the results of the between-group factorial design experiment: The efficiency of the shared mental model was lost when predicting team performance in an uncertain environment. Teams with a cooperative structure outperformed teams with a competitive structure in the task changes, and this effect was mediated by shared mental model updating. Thus, team managers should adopt a cooperative-based structure in an uncertain environment to achieve team adaptation, as well as training team members to understand the changed situation.},

Attitudes toward increased cross-cultural contact associated with globalization vary depending on whether contact is perceived as a threat that disrupts psychological functions of one’s own culture. I tested the hypothesis that belief about the dynamic connectedness of cultures, that is, polyculturalism, would be associated with the effects of increased contact through globalization being perceived more positively. Those who believe in polyculturalism assume fewer fixed cultural boundaries; thus, cross-cultural contact is not perceived as being disruptive. Data obtained from 598 undergraduate university students in Macau supported this hypothesis. It was found that polyculturalism was associated with more positive perceptions of the effects of globalization on the economy and culture of Macau, and there was a positive trend in the perceived effect of migration on Macau society. Although effect sizes were small, belief in polyculturalism could be further explored as a factor that predisposes individuals to take more positive attitudes about globalization.},

Focusing on the theory of planned behavior, we obtained data from 678 residents of urban villages in a city of Southwestern Hubei Province, and used the logit model to identify and assess the factors influencing urban villagers’ decisions to engage in illegal construction behavior. Findings indicated that residents were more likely to engage in illegal construction if their relatives had done so, showing some degree of herd behavior. Social networks were also found to matter, in that those who knew more law enforcement officers were more likely to engage in illegal construction behavior and it was less likely that a resident who was new to a village would do so. These findings are helpful in setting up regulation policies that will better prevent illegal construction behaviors.},

We examined the path effect of humor style (HS) in terms of ability emotional intelligence (EI) and life satisfaction (LS) with 260 Chinese university students. The ability EI, HS, and LS of participants were measured with Chinese language versions of the measures, including the Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Humor Styles Questionnaire, and the Life Satisfaction Scale. We found that EI and LS were positively correlated. Positive HS (affiliative and self-enhancing) positively mediated EI and LS, and negative HS (aggressive and self-defeating) mediated EI and LS negatively. After control had been established for the other mediating variables, self-enhancing HS accounted for more variance in EI and LS than did the other 3 HS. These results increase understanding of how individuals with strong ability to regulate their emotions via a concrete HS improve their LS. Lastly, we recommended a process and mechanism for improving LS with EI.},

Results showed that female students were more gender egalitarian than were male students. Female students with traditional gender role attitudes were more likely to be from rural than urban areas, display lower subjective health, and report lower life satisfaction. Male students with traditional gender role attitudes scored higher on life satisfaction than did traditional females. The results imply that exposure to urban living experiences leads to more egalitarian gender role attitudes, and that this attitude is accompanied by better psychological well-being for females.

The results of the field experiment show that ambiguous disconfirmation leads to dilution of the implication of scarcity and therefore the value of the product, whereas unambiguous disconfirmation leads to reversal of the positive effect of shelf-based scarcity on product evaluation.

In this study we built on scarcity theory, to conduct two experiments in which we investigated the influence of arbitrary numbers we inserted into brand names of luxury products. In Study 1 we recruited 68 consumers who were each assigned to one of two groups (small number or big number for brand name), in order to test consumers’ preferences for luxury brands with names of different number magnitudes. The results revealed that a product with a small number in the brand name was received more favorably than was a product with a big number in the name. Scarcity mediated the relationship between number magnitude and preference. In Study 2 we tested the moderating role of involvement. Number magnitude of the brand name influenced preference through scarcity when involvement was high but not when it was low. Thus, we found that numbers in the name of a luxury brand arbitrarily impacted consumers’ perceptions of scarcity, which influenced their preference in regard to brand. This relationship was moderated by involvement. The results suggest that manufacturers of luxury brands should use a small number in their brand name, and should increase the degree of consumer involvement to elevate consumer preference for the brand.},

Responses to paper-based surveys were collected during classes from students majoring in hospitality and tourism in 5 high-level universities in South Korea. We analyzed 401 responses by using a series of multiple regression analyses based on forward selection. The results showed that air quality, odor, noise, and equipment/amenity are essential physical classroom environment factors in determining attitude, perception of quality, and satisfaction. Attitude toward the course completely mediates the effect of odor on satisfaction, and quality partially mediates the impact of equipment/amenity on satisfaction. Overall, in this study we identified the salient role of certain features of the classroom physical environment in building students’ satisfaction with a course via attitudes toward, and evaluation of the quality of the course.},

We investigated the independent associations of 3 types of sedentary behavior with depression, anxiety, and sleep quality among 214 Chinese university students. Self-reported sedentary behavior was assessed by the length of time that participants spent on television viewing/computer use, and smartphone use. We used the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to evaluate depressive status and anxiety symptoms, respectively, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess sleep quality. The results showed that longer smartphone use was associated with worse SDS, SAS, and PSQI scores. There was no association between the time spent on television viewing and computer use, and depression, anxiety, and poor sleep quality.},

We found that supportive, justice, and ethical climates are valuable to OBC customers. Results showed that supportive and justice climates positively influenced psychological capital, but the influence of ethical climate was nonsignificant.

Scholars have reported that mental toughness (MT) moderates stress, helps with regaining balance after failure, and promotes mobilizing action. Accordingly, we used the Mental Toughness Questionnaire-48 to explore stage-related MT differences in a sample of 342 teenagers representing 3 stages of adolescence: 11-year-olds (early adolescence; n = 104), 14-year-olds (middle adolescence; n = 125), and 17-year-olds (late adolescence; n = 113), who came from either a large city or a small town. Analysis revealed that although MT increased across the stages of adolescence, the degree of change varied between subscales of the Mental Toughness Questionnaire-48: challenge and confidence increased, whereas control and commitment remained unchanged. Moreover, age effects also varied as a function of community size. The findings illustrate the advantage of using a multi-dimensional model of toughness for better understanding its development processes. Moreover, they could inform the design of training programs aimed at targeting problem behaviors, for example, encouraging attendance at and enhancing academic performance programs.},

This test was presented via one of three stimuli: auditory, visual, or dual sensory (auditory and visual simultaneously). The findings revealed that the diameter of the pupils of the guilty group increased differently according to the question type when both auditory and visual stimuli were presented simultaneously.

Researchers have focused on how to improve the high-stress environment for those working in China’s public sector, but neglected to consider the moderating effect of age of employees. Using data from 410 public sector employees in Shandong Province, China, we investigated the effects of emotional dissonance and work meaningfulness on employees’ perceived level of stress, and the moderating effect of age on those effects. Results indicated that work meaningfulness reduced participants’ perceived stress levels, and that emotional dissonance increased perceived stress, which is consistent with previous research findings. Further, age played a moderating role by weakening the effect of work meaningfulness, but the moderating effect of age on emotional dissonance was nonsignificant. Managers of public sectors should be aware of the differences between older and younger employees and adopt appropriate practices to help employees deal with their work stress.},

Understanding of what drives mainstream consumers to purchase ethnic-inspired designs (EID) is lacking, and even less is understood about the self-centric values (personal values and product values) and the goal pursuits (enhancing self-view confidence) they project by consuming EID. We set out to fill this void, using image theory as a conceptual framework on data collected by a marketing research firm from 1,153 women on its female consumer panel. We found that mainstream consumers’ aspirations to enhance self-view confidence (self-enhancement) are a key driver determining their purchase intent toward EID products. We also found that self-enhancement is directly influenced by the product values (perceived aesthetics and novelty) of EID, and the effects of personal values (cultural openness and seeking personal style) on self-enhancement are mediated by product values.},

As we had assumed, Chinese civil servants manifested a strong sense of despair, which was consistent between the genders. In general, however, depression had a greater impact on female than on male civil servants. In the linear regression model with demographic variables as independent variables, we found that gender, education level, and marital status were significant predictive factors of depression, but income and age were not. We suggest that although civil servants may enjoy a more lucrative job and a better material lifestyle compared to other people in China, the issue of their mental health merits attention.},

We conducted 3 studies to test the hypothesis that a format effect is not always present at every level of probability, and even when a format effect occurs, it depends on risk level and emotion. In Study 1, the risk of a flood threatening participants’ homes (familiar risk) regardless of change in emotion, occurred only at a 5% probability level. In Study 2, when facing an unfamiliar risk (being infected by Chikungunya fever), regardless of change in emotion, a format effect occurred at the level of 5% probability only when emotion was positive. In Study 3, a format effect occurred at a 5% probability level when prior emotion expectation was positive and risk consequences were emphasized.

We recruited 163 participants to observe a dictator game, and then choose either to punish the dictator or compensate the recipient, each of whom could be from the participant’s in-group or out-group. Third parties often chose not to punish in-group dictators and to compensate both in-group victims and out-group victims. When out-group members transgressed against the in-group, participants punished these out-group members just as often as they compensated the in-group recipients, although they punished out-group dictators more harshly than others overall. However, when both proposer and recipient came from the out-group, participants often did not intervene. We also found that third-party punishment and compensation were related to individual differences in participants’ trait empathy and Machiavellianism.

We built on previous research findings regarding effects of emotion on context processing, examining whether or not high arousal states of different valence affect context processing. We measured context processing using the AX-continuous performance task paradigm. To manipulate emotional arousal, 60 participants were exposed to short clips from existing feature films showing either a social interaction (control condition), a violent encounter (negative arousal condition), or an episode of sexual intercourse (positive arousal condition). Analyses of signal detection measures showed that, compared to the control and positive-arousal groups, participants in the negative-arousal group displayed selective impairment of context processing. Results indicated that alterations in context processing by increased arousal are valence specific.},

We investigated factors influencing enrollment choice at fitness centers in South Korea to estimate the relative importance of each factor to the customers. We analyzed data obtained from 283 customers who were enrolled at fitness centers in Seoul. Results were as follows: First, equipment, environment, accessibility, and membership fee were the primary factors that influenced customers’ enrollment at fitness centers; second, customers placed membership fee as most important, then environment, accessibility, and equipment, in that order. We also examined the relative importance of choice factors according to how long individuals had been enrolled and exercised at the center. Results indicated that all customers made the same choices for the order of importance of the factors regardless of the length of time they had been enrolled at and using the center. However, results revealed that as the period of time they had been exercising at the center increased, the relative importance of the factors that directly affect exercise environment and equipment increased—that is environment and equipment— whereas the importance of membership fee and accessibility, which do not directly influence exercise, decreased. These results indicate that, for effective customer retention, managers of fitness centers should conduct customer segmentation by taking into consideration how long each individual customer has been coming to exercise at the center, and the factors considered important to each.},

Results showed that organizational identification mediated the relationships between perceived organizational support and work engagement, and between organizational image and work engagement. However, self-esteem exerted no significant influence on the focal relationships. Our findings suggest that organizational identification plays a key role in deciding the extent to which TAWs engage in work at their current organization. Organizations should take steps to enhance their reputations and support TAWs as much as possible to increase TAWs’ organizational identification and thus achieve a competitive advantage.},

The results showed that trust in colleagues strengthened the negative relationship between employees’ deep acting and emotional exhaustion but also exacerbated the positive relationship between employees’ surface acting and emotional exhaustion. The exacerbating effect of trust was especially strong for female surface actors. The findings suggest that women have a propensity for risk aversion and are more sensitive to the establishment of trust relationships than are men. Managers should consider surface acting as part of the makeup of the psychological well-being of employees.},

Thus, I investigated women’s and men’s perceptions of emotional faces in predictable and unpredictable conditions. Results showed that behaviorally, women’s response accuracy was higher than men’s. In contrast, neurally, men had greater P1 amplitudes for happy faces compared with angry faces in right hemisphere electrodes, suggesting that men have a perceptual bias toward happy faces. Further, women exhibited larger N170 amplitudes for predictable versus unpredictable angry faces in right hemisphere electrodes. This may reflect enhanced sensitivity to detecting anger. Finally, there was a significant positive correlation between behavioral and N170 predictability effects. This result may indicate that emotion prediction enhances neural responses while improving recognition efficiency at the behavioral level. In this respect, the electrophysiological results and behavioral data were consistent.},

Results from the hierarchical generalized linear model generally supported the network dynamic model, showing that social networks are critical to the underprivileged who lack resource mobilization opportunities. Specifically, the bridging and linking qualities of social networks produced a strong influence on collective action more than any other variable. However, the effect of community-level social trust was small and did not explain the extent to which individual-level social networks exerted influence on collective action.},

Results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between extraversion and emotional expression and a partial mediating role of self-esteem between extraversion and emotional expression, and that the mediating role of self-esteem was moderated by emotional intelligence. Indirect effects were more significant in participants with high versus low emotional intelligence. Thus, the influence of extraversion on emotional expression was a moderated mediation effect.

We integrated the theory of reasoned action and leader–member exchange (LMX) to construct a research model of the relationship between supervisor narcissism and employee silence. Through a 3-wave survey with 292 employees of 3 Chinese companies, we examined the relationship between supervisor narcissism and employee silence, the mediating role of negative anticipations, and the moderating role of LMX. Results showed that supervisor narcissism had a significant positive impact on employee silence, and negative anticipations played a partial mediating role between them. LMX significantly moderated the relationship between supervisor narcissism and negative anticipations, with a positive correlation between supervisor narcissism and negative anticipations that was more significant in the condition of low LMX than in high LMX. We also found that LMX negatively moderated the mediating effect of negative anticipations on the relationship between supervisor narcissism and employee silence, whereby the higher the quality of the LMX the weaker was the mediating effect.},

Examining individual differences in the intrinsic motivations for social media use is essential for determining what causes individuals to enjoy using social networking sites and to engage more consistently in online activities. We analyzed data obtained from a survey of 227 users of social networking sites in China. We tested the hypothesized model using structural equation modeling. Research findings revealed that personality traits are the best predictors of intrinsic motivations for social media use. The Big Five traits of agreeableness and extraversion positively affected social interaction and self-presentation, whereas conscientiousness negatively affected self-presentation. Additionally, the results indicated that demographic variables of age and gender affect intrinsic motivations for social media use. Compared with females, males were more likely to utilize social media to express themselves and expand their social interactions. Moreover, participants older than 25 years demonstrated a lower level of self-presentational needs than did those aged 25 and younger. Our findings further confirm that differences among individuals, largely rooted in personality traits and demographic characteristics, contribute to various motivations for social media use.},

To explore the neuro-mechanism of the time course of processing a hurt situation, we analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) generated in the brain in response to stimuli in individuals with different degrees of forgiveness. Participants were 216 university students. Of the early ERP components, the negative-deflecting N1 was modulated neither by degree of forgiveness nor by the hurt situation, and the positive-deflecting P2 was larger for low-for-giveness than for high-forgiveness participants, and for low-hurt than for high-hurt situations. The N2, which identifies and encodes stimulus, was enhanced in the high-forgiveness group and for high-hurt situations. Importantly, the late positive component (LPC) stage of stimulus evaluation was larger in the high-forgiveness group for high-hurt situations, but in the low-forgiveness group was evident for low-hurt situations. These data indicate that the modulation of forgiveness on processing hurt situations occurs at the late stage of information processing.},

We conducted a field study with 141 construction workers and car-accessory-manufacturing workers in China. The results indicated that upward counterfactual thinking mediated the positive relationship between learning goal orientation and safety participation, whereas downward counterfactual thinking mediated the negative relationship between performance goal orientation and safety participation. The findings together highlight the significance of goal orientation and counterfactual thinking in influencing people’s safety behavior in the workplace.},

The results revealed that the purchase intention behavior relied on consumer inertia, which increased when consumers were confused because they were less capable of making rational buying decisions when choosing between retailer brands in the marketplace. In a marketing campaign context, our findings show that substantial differentiation is crucial for convenience store chains to strengthen the belief system and behavioral routines of their customers, thereby helping the convenience stores to strengthen their brand image, build consumer trust, achieve a competitive advantage, and capture a greater share of the market in both the short and long term.},

Previous researchers have suggested that members of individualist and collectivist cultures differ in the degree to which they perceive objects either analytically and context-independently or holistically and context-dependently. Cross-culture variation in FDI has been thoroughly studied, whereas within-culture investigations have seldom been undertaken. We explored the within-culture variation of FDI with 593 Chinese colleague students, via administering the Embedded Figures Test. As we predicted, results showed that participants from the more individualist north China area exhibited stronger degrees of field independence than did their more collectivist southern counterparts. We have supported and extended the notion that culture affects individual experiences on a basic perceptual level with new within-culture data.},

  abstract = {© 2018 Scientific Journal Publishers Limited. All Rights Reserved. Marketers often employ scarcity messages to attract consumers. In this study, we showed that consumers make inferences about the truth or falsity of scarcity claims. When consumers interpret scarcity as a value signal, scarcity will positively influence product evaluation. In contrast, when scarcity is interpreted as a signal with manipulative intent, the positive effect of scarcity on product evaluation is reduced. Accordingly, we identified reversibility of decision as a moderating factor in the positive effect of scarcity on product evaluation. Results showed that scarcity had a positive effect on product evaluation only when reversibility of decision was high. Further, this effect was mediated by an inference process, whereby consumers perceived scarcity claims to be either a signal of product value or of manipulative intent. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Results confirmed the hypotheses that the executive’s perception of the mentor’s passion was positively related to the executive’s perception of organizational innovativeness, through the quality of mentoring and cognitive adaptability. Confirmatory factor analysis and regression analysis confirmed the validity of the results. Results demonstrated the value of passion in executive mentoring and the subsequent link to organizational innovativeness via the quality of mentoring and cognitive adaptability.

Drawing upon the statistical records of the season’s games for the pitcher that were contained in the prosecutor’s reports and game-by-game records for each Chinese Professional Baseball League pitcher in the 2009 regular season, I used the change-point test and difference-in-differences techniques to identify anomalies in the pitcher’s play.

The proposed model and hypotheses were in general supported by data collected from a field survey completed by 270 visitors to museums in Seoul, South Korea. Results of structural equation modeling analysis indicated that anticipated feelings had a significant direct impact on visitors’ behavioral intentions and mediated the influence of environmental awareness on intentions. Moreover, through a test for metric invariance, we established that it was more suitable to use environmental awareness as an independent variable rather than as a moderator variable.

Participants (N = 141) completed a postfire survey assessing perceived danger, presence of close others, group evacuation, emergency responses, and pre-evacuation time. Results showed that (1) individuals with close others tended to delay their evacuation and exhibit more affiliation behaviors; (2) when with close others, women (vs. men) were more likely to exhibit affiliation and less likely to exhibit helping behaviors; and (3) regardless of the presence of close others, helping behaviors were more likely to occur when the situation was perceived as more dangerous.

Using data from the 2010 China General Social Survey, we applied logistic regression analysis to explore the relationships between unfair experience, interests involved, political efficacy, and the likelihood of participation in collective action. Results showed that people who have experienced unfair treatment from the government are more likely than other people are to participate in collective action. If people think that collective action is closely related to their own interests, they are more likely to participate than are those who do not think so. Also, people with high internal political efficacy are more likely to participate in collective action than are those with low internal political efficacy. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

As people with different personalities make different psychological contracts, we hypothesized that the Asian-specific factor of Confucianism would moderate the relationship between 3 personality factors, namely, neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness, and the formation of psychological contracts. Thus, we surveyed 217 people employed in organizations in China, and found a moderating effect of Confucianism on the relationship between conscientiousness and relational psychological contracts.

No main effects of external attributions and social media exposure were found. However, the interaction effect between external attributions and social media exposure was significant.

We aimed to determine the extent to which the 3 dimensions of basic psychological need satisfaction (i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness) explain the association between supervisory mentoring and newcomers’ work engagement. Participants were 438 work newcomers living in a large coastal city in eastern China. We assessed supervisory mentoring, basic psychological need satisfaction, and work engagement in 3 time waves, each spaced 1 month apart. Findings indicated that supervisory mentoring was positively related to newcomers’ work engagement, and that this relationship was mediated by the 3 dimensions (need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness) of basic psychological need satisfaction. This provides a perspective for supervisors to improve newcomers’ work engagement by enhancing the satisfaction of their basic needs.},

Thus, both parties should develop an understanding based on their views and experiences, which necessitates more opportunities to communicate with frankness and authenticity.

We tested our hypotheses using data from 325 teams of employees at 10 companies in South Korea. Results showed that task knowledge diversity was positively associated with team creativity and a team’s status inequality in terms of organizational tenure moderated the relationship in a negative way.

A survey was carried out with 263 participants from 40 firms in China, who completed mature, established scales, and hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression modeling. The empirical results showed that quantitative job insecurity reduced organizational deviance and increased interpersonal deviance, whereas qualitative job insecurity increased both organizational and interpersonal deviance. Moreover, internal locus of control weakened the positive relationship between job insecurity and workplace deviance. Therefore, qualitative job insecurity was more detrimental than quantitative job insecurity in terms of workplace deviance, and both were more detrimental to those who are of an external locus of control.},

Capitalization is an interpersonal process where one shares personal positive events with others and receives benefits beyond that event’s effect. The response a capitalizer perceives from the recipient determines the success of this process. The Perceived Responses to Capitalization Attempts Scale (PRCAS) is an English-language measure used to assess a capitalizer’s perception of a recipient’s responses. We tested the factor structure, internal consistency reliability, and concurrent validity of the Chinese version of the PRCAS with a sample of 1,213 Chinese college students. Factor analyses replicated the 4-factor model of active–constructive response, passive–constructive response, active–destructive response, and passive–destructive response. All subscales possessed satisfactory internal consistency and evidence for concurrent validity with measures of feeling, flourishing, self-esteem, and mental health symptoms. We also assessed the test–retest stability of the PRCAS with a separate sample of 119 Chinese college students, and found that the subscales possessed low test–retest reliability. Therefore, the Chinese PRCAS possessed acceptable psychometric properties.},

In contrast to previous research, I found that referents’ pay level was more important than gender in explicating men’s and women’s pay satisfaction levels. However, this association is limited. Even when women compared themselves with referents at the same levels as the men were using as comparison, women’s pay level satisfaction differed from that of the men in that women have relatively lower pay level satisfaction because of upward comparisons. This suggests that women are needed as managerial role models in organizations to improve other women’s expectations of pay and accomplishments, and top executives need to encourage women, so they are not undervalued or underemployed.},

Past research on citizenship behavior has pointed primarily to its voluntary side— organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)—but some scholars have suggested that there is a nonvoluntary version of citizenship behavior—compulsory citizenship behavior (CCB). Drawing on conservation of resources theory and social identity theory, in this research we firstly examined the psychological mechanism underlying the relationship between CCB and the critical workplace deviant behavior of employee silence by developing a moderated mediation model wherein CCB predicted subordinates’ silence behavior through emotional exhaustion, with organizational identification acting as the boundary condition. Results from 2-wave lagged data (N = 242) collected in the manufacturing sector in China support our hypothesized model. We found that CCB was positively related to employee silence, and emotional exhaustion fully mediated this relationship; organizational identification weakened the relationship between CCB and emotional exhaustion, and organizational identification weakened the indirect effect of CCB on employee silence via emotional exhaustion. Contributions, practical implications, and several promising avenues for future research are discussed.},

We compared individual and joint risk-based decision making using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, with a focus on participants’ (160 Chinese men) emotional experience during decision making and their Big Five personality traits as measured by the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. We found that, compared with the individual decision-making process, making a joint decision led to reduced risk taking and increased earnings, and brought a greater sense of control, stronger feelings of achievement and happiness, and a reduced sense of regret for the participants. The Big Five personality traits of the participants were related to their risk-based decision making; participants tended to act differently according to their personality traits during individual and joint decision making. Our findings show that, compared with individual decision making, joint decision making has many advantages.},

We explored the underlying mechanism for South Korean university students’ negative responses to English-medium instruction (EMI) courses. Specifically, English language anxiety and confidence, and EMI course attitudes and avoidance were analyzed using survey data from 187 Korean university students. Results showed that English language anxiety played a key role in both EMI course attitudes and avoidance, and also affected student achievement in EMI courses. Students’ English language confidence and their perceptions of their instructors’ English language competence were found to be unrelated to EMI course attitudes and avoidance, but were negatively related to English language anxiety. In addition, students’ EMI course content understanding and grades did not directly influence EMI course avoidance, but did indirectly influence course avoidance through EMI course attitudes. Our results highlight the importance of addressing students’ emotional challenges and attitudes to improve their motivation to take EMI courses.},

We used a longitudinal design to examine peer interaction in youth sport as an antecedent of changes in sport confidence and achievement goal orientation (comprising task and ego orientation). At the beginning of the winter playing season, 141 children and adolescents (from 8 to 15 years of age) who were members of soccer clubs in the Midwest of the USA, completed the Sport Confidence Inventory (SCI) and the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ), and 51 of the original respondent group also completed the SCI, the TEOSQ, and a social network measure at the end of the playing season. To assess the effect of peer interaction on the young soccer players, we employed the influence model in social network analysis. The results showed that interaction with peers in the same age group positively influenced changes in task goal orientation and in sport confidence in regard to cognitive efficiency and resilience. In contrast, ego goal orientation was positively affected by interaction with peers in a different age group. The results increase understanding of young people’s sport motivation as a function of their peer interaction.},

Through a regression analysis of the factors associated with the business ethical sensitivity of 417 Chinese insurance agents, we found that gender played an important role in affecting business ethical sensitivity, and empathy significantly affected business ethical sensitivity. Furthermore, empathy had a moderating effect on the relationship between gender and business ethical sensitivity. Both men and women with strong empathy scored high on business ethical sensitivity; however, men with strong empathy had higher levels of business ethical sensitivity than did women with little empathy.

We examined how group identification and intergroup anxiety jointly mediate the relationship between negative metastereotype and intergroup relations among rural-to-urban migrant children in China. Migrant children, who have both rural and urban identities, are sensitive to their uncertain status, which means that a negative metastereotype is easily activated. We recruited 105 migrant children who were randomly assigned to two groups. They received either a negative metastereotype or control manipulation. Intergroup anxiety, group identification, and intergroup relations were then assessed. Results showed that intergroup anxiety and urban identification could independently mediate the effects of a negative metastereotype on intergroup relations. Intergroup anxiety indirectly influenced intergroup relations through urban identification. These findings suggest that negative emotion and urban identification should be considered when studying the negative metastereotype of migrant children in China and should be included when planning interventions to improve intergroup relations of these children.},

Effects of benign and malicious envy were also assessed across scenarios. In the input and output scenarios, malicious envy positively predicted prosocial behaviors and benign envy negatively predicted prosocial behaviors, whereas the opposite was true in the input-output scenario.

Using well-controlled gray-scale images of people’s faces without salient relatively lower level race-specific features, such as color of hair and eyes, we investigated whether or not there is a visual search advantage for other-race over own-race faces. We found that both Chinese (n = 48) and Caucasian (n = 48) participants used serial and self-terminating search techniques, but neither racial group used pop-out or parallel search methods. An advantage favoring other-race faces was observed in visual search among Chinese participants, whereas neither advantage nor disadvantage was observed for other-race faces among the Caucasian participants. We discuss the mechanism underlying visual search to identify race of faces. Further, although the current data do not exclude the possibility of cultural diversity across races in regard to visual search, our findings point to the importance of observer’s race in cross-cultural studies in which visual search of human faces is used.},

  abstract = {© 2017 Scientific Journal Publishers Limited. All Rights Reserved. Despite the abundance of marketing literature on consumer complaint behavior, little research has been conducted to explicate such behavior from a generational perspective. I therefore investigated the complaint behavior of 2 generations in Pakistan, namely, mothers and daughters. I used a qualitative interview approach with 5 pairs of dyads. All interviews were transcribed and content analysis was performed. Findings showed that the mothers would most likely seek redress in person, would complain to others verbally, or would take no action. The daughters tended to seek redress in person and to tell others about the problem using electronic media. There was similarity between mothers and daughters in seeking redress and showing anger. The study thus serves as a precursor to future investigation of complaint behavior by different generation cohorts in the same family and of the potential transmission of behavioral values.},

Participants were 291 Master of Business Administration students, and we applied structural equation modeling to the collected data to thoroughly analyze the direct and indirect effects between factors. Results showed that stronger guanxi between 2 parties was associated with both parties caring less about face. Further, the expectancy of individuals to realize specific knowledge-sharing goals and a good organizational climate, rather than the formal organizational system, were also found to play a role in willingness to share knowledge. Finally, we found that face motivations varied across individuals.},

Institutionalized socialization tactics assist new employees, whose voice is insufficiently encouraged, in adjusting to their work environment. In this time-lagged quantitative field study with 221 new generation employees in Beijing, China, we explored institutionalized socialization tactics and their influence on voice behavior, and newcomer adjustment as a form of voice behavior mediation.

Empirical results from 266 respondents who were customers at 193 restaurants supported most of our hypotheses. Mediation analysis indicated that the relationship between friendship and product valuation was jointly mediated by psychological ownership and attitudes toward the seller; however, the mediating role of product knowledge was not supported, which suggests that in the context of friendship, judgments about products are based more on the friend than on the product itself.

We examined the relationship between parental psychological control and their children’s test anxiety in the Chinese cultural context, and tested the mediating role of the children’s academic self-efficacy in this relationship. Chinese high-school students (N = 401, 158 boys and 243 girls), aged between 15 and 18 years, completed a self-report survey assessing parental psychological control, academic self-efficacy, and test anxiety. The results showed a positive association between parental psychological control and the students’ test anxiety. The students’ academic self-efficacy was negatively correlated with parental psychological control and the students’ test anxiety. Additionally, results of structural equation modeling indicated that the students’ academic self-efficacy partially mediated the effect of their perception of parental psychological control on their test anxiety. These results reveal the negative influence of parental psychological control on their children’s test anxiety and identify academic self-efficacy as a mediating variable through which parental psychological control exerts effects on their children’s test anxiety.},

In addition, the inclusion of HBM factors, consumption-related factors, and green advertising attitude in the model resulted in a better predictor of behavioral intention. Our findings suggest that ecological consumption is influenced by consumers’ past experience with green marketing as well as their beliefs about environmental issues.

After 7-10 days they read a stimulus framing message focused on international relief campaigns against child hunger, and then rated message attitudes, intention to support children in need, and perceived manipulation intent. Results showed that there was an interaction effect between DEC and framing on responses to messages advocating international relief activities. Further, this interaction was mainly the result of gain, rather than loss, framing, with more favorable responses elicited from individuals with greater DEC.},

The results demonstrated that the relationship between the perceived effectiveness of merit pay policy and PSM is U-shaped. That is, teachers’ PSM declined in the case of a weak perception of policy effectiveness but improved when teachers perceived that policy effectiveness was high. In addition, policy expectations moderated this link, suggesting that taking this variable into account can help to improve teachers’ acceptance of the reward policy.

Results showed that, when product failure was severe, the women had lower satisfaction than the men did for consumer-caused failure, but not for company-caused failure. Utilizing a defensive attribution framework, we ran a mediation analysis to identify why such differences occur. The analysis suggested that defensive motivation, whereby the individual avoids self-blame for severe failure, was heightened more for women than for men. Our findings suggest that, when a product failure is consumer-caused, companies must react more rapidly when managing female consumers than when managing male ones. Further, companies should carefully consider recovery strategies that mitigate dissatisfaction, even for less severe company-caused failure.},

Results showed that PsyCap significantly influenced feedback-seeking behavior, and that feedback cognition fully mediated this relationship. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

We conducted 2 experiments to explore whether or not ego depletion from exerting prior self-control lowers an individual’s construal level and thus, in turn, affects the individual’s goal preference. Experiment 1 (N = 132) involved a 2 (ego depletion: present vs. absent) × 2 (priming-focus feature: temporality vs. probability) between-subject design. The results showed that people whose ego was depleted from exerting prior self-control would be more motivated to pursue a temporally proximal uncertain goal than were those whose ego was not depleted. In Experiment 2 (N = 138) we used a 2 (ego depletion: present vs. absent) × 2 (social distance of the goal being pursued: for self vs. for others) between-subject design to test the generalizability of the finding in Experiment 1. The results showed that people whose ego was depleted would be motivated to pursue a goal that was certain with a lower end value, especially when setting a goal for others. Our finding that ego depletion lowered individuals’ construal level and, thus, made them focus more on subordinate features of a goal supports both self-control theory and construal-level theory.},

Variables regarding sexual experiences, experience of contraception, and substance and alcohol use were extracted and analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression. The results showed that fewer than 30% of the respondents reported always using contraception, and almost half reported rarely using contraception. The number of boys and girls reporting having had sexual experiences increased from 2 to 4 times when they also reported use of illicit drugs, smoking tobacco, or alcohol consumption.

Organizational behavior researchers have typically focused on role- or structure-based power, such as hierarchical status and position in the social network. In contrast, we examined the psychological experience of power in organizations. Our purpose was to determine how and when a team leader’s subjective sense of power is beneficial in an organizational context. Data were collected from 70 work teams using a 2-wave design to test the proposed model. Results showed that a team leader’s sense of power enhanced team performance by decreasing leader–member relationship conflict, but only when perceived task interdependence was high. These associations remained after controlling for hierarchical status and demographic characteristics. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Although findings reported in an increasing number of studies shed light on the relationship between optimism and entrepreneurial outcomes, little is known of the mechanisms by which entrepreneurial optimism influences new venture performance. Researchers have found that people who are highly optimistic build more extensive social networks than others do, which can influence the outcome of their efforts. In order to explore the relationships among entrepreneurial optimism, social networks, and new venture performance, we analyzed data obtained from 142 Chinese entrepreneurs. Results indicated that entrepreneurial optimism had a significant impact on social network size, social network heterogeneity, and new venture performance. Social network size fully mediated the relationship between entrepreneurial optimism and new venture performance, but social network heterogeneity did not have a mediating role. These findings support the application of a social network perspective to gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which entrepreneurial optimism influences new venture performance.},

The results showed that the IAT was reliable in an Asian context with offenders, and that the onset-offenders demonstrated greater aggression compared with those in the recidivist and nonoffender groups. Our findings suggest that onset-offenders may have more accurate self-awareness than do recidivists and incarceration may influence attitudes toward aggression in a positive way.

Results indicated that consumers’ attitude and intention were influenced mainly by product range and, simultaneously, that their decision to buy digital music was influenced by attitude and subjective norms. The results suggest that as trialability had a nonsignificant impact on consumer intention and attitude, consumers’ perceived risk may be lowered by reducing the cost of digital music.},

Results of structural equation modeling revealed the model of objectification theory provided a poor fit to the data for both genders, but 2 exploratory models with good fit were generated after subsequent modification to the model. For women, body shame and appearance anxiety mediated the relationships among body surveillance, disordered eating, and depressed mood. Furthermore, body surveillance indirectly influenced women’s level of internal awareness and flow via body shame and appearance anxiety, which led to disordered eating and depressed mood. This pattern of relationships was similar for men, except for flow, which was not related to the outcome variables. We concluded that objectification theory is applicable to women and men in China.},

We explored the stability of, and between-group differences in, the implicit self-esteem of Internet-addicted and Internet-nonaddicted college students in China. Internet addiction was assessed using Young’s Internet Addiction Scale and the participants comprised 52 Internet addicts (26 men, 26 women) and 52 Internet nonaddicts (26 men, 26 women). We then used the Implicit Association Test to assess levels of implicit self-esteem, employing a 2 (addiction, nonaddiction) × 2 (positive feedback, negative feedback) between-subjects factorial design. The pretest implicit self-esteem level of the Internet-addicted group was significantly higher than that of the control group; however, the implicit self-esteem levels of both groups were unstable. Positive feedback did not change the level of implicit self-esteem of the Internet addiction group. In future studies researchers need to pay more attention to the measurement of implicit self-esteem, long-term stability, and addiction to online games.},

We conducted a study with 223 undergraduate student participants to test our hypotheses. Results showed that individuals in a low-power state were more prone to conspicuous consumption when they were in social exclusion than when they were socially included. In contrast, individuals in a high-power state did not exhibit any significant difference in terms of conspicuous consumption, whether or not they were socially excluded or included.

In addition, because of differences in their attitudes toward recycling, their subjective norms, and their perceived behavior control, there was a significant difference in recycling behavior between people with a predominantly independent self-construal and people with a predominantly interdependent self-construal.

In Study 2 (N = 57), we replicated in a different domain this risk-taking tendency of benignly envious individuals, examined the process by which benign envy increases risk taking, and demonstrated that individuals who feel benign, compared to malicious, envy perceive less threat in risk taking. Our findings suggest that benign envy can lead to risk taking and self-improving behavior, owing to the motivation to improve oneself.},

In Study 3, we found that social distance mediated the influence of money concept on the consumers’ need for uniqueness. Overall, the results showed that consumers who are primed with money perceive greater social distance and have a stronger need for uniqueness.},

The mediation analysis indicated that loneliness completely mediated the association between explicit self-esteem and pathological Internet use among adolescents, implying that lower explicit self-esteem was correlated with greater loneliness, which was then associated with greater pathological Internet use. Accordingly, enhancing adolescents’ self-esteem and decreasing their feelings of loneliness may function as a preventive measure to help teenagers relieve their levels of pathological Internet use.},

The results of a serial multivariable mediation analysis partly supported the idea that competence belief, achievement goals, and effort act as mediators in the relationship between gender stereotypes and mathematics performance. Specifically, gender stereotypes about mathematics had a negative direct and indirect effect on Chinese female students’ mathematics performance: the girls with a stronger gender stereotype were serially associated with less competence belief, lower performance-approach goals, and less effort, all of which, in turn, were associated with poorer performance in mathematics. However, gender stereotypes about mathematics did not predict the level of Chinese male students’ performance at mathematics.

Contrary to previous research findings both from Malaysia, and from North American and other Western-culture samples, there were positive significant direct effects of materialism on product satisfaction for consumers in both countries. The results of the mediating effect (materialistic values → product status signaling → product satisfaction) indicated that, for Saudis, the effect was positive and moderate in strength, whereas for Malaysians, the effect was positive and strong. The overall results showed that product status signaling acted as a partial mediator in the relationship between materialistic values and product satisfaction. On the basis of these results, it is important for marketers to understand that both Malaysian and Saudi consumers—Saudis in particular—tend to rely, and focus, on the symbolic meanings attached to products that will only be successfully communicated if the symbolism in the product is socially and visibly recognized by these consumers.

Revisit intentions explained 64% of the variance in the proposed relationships. We have added to the literature on consumer behavior in the context of dance performance by uncovering the formation of revisit intentions through the use of the extended marketing mix and service evaluation variables.},

We randomly assigned 90 college students to either an MCII intervention condition or a control condition. The results showed that participants in the MCII intervention group did not exert more effort in reading the book than did the participants in the control condition. However, analysis within the MCII intervention condition group showed that the number of written words in the MCII exercise phase (quantity), the integrity of the participants’ implementation intention, and the mental contrasting specificity (quality) of MCII affected the participants’ reading behavior and achievement. Finally, further analysis of mental contrasting content revealed that, compared with participants for whom the obstacles to completing the assigned reading were internal, such as lack of self-control or lack of interest in the subject matter, participants who identified external obstacles, such as the need to complete other study assignments or to work in part-time employment, spent more time on reading the assigned book.

Results showed that for both the Chinese and Western-style paintings in 3 price anchoring and 3 price nonanchoring conditions, 3 factors affected the bidding for the artworks: Positive attraction, artistic quality, and cognitive stimulation. Of these factors positive attraction and artistic quality were the primary influences. In each condition, positive attraction was always the positive predictor of the bidders’ offering, emphasizing the importance of the artwork’s aesthetic value. In contrast, artistic quality deterred participants from bidding. In addition, whether or not there was a reference-point price made a difference in the traditional Chinese group of artworks. Bidders wished to offer a higher price only if the price had been high for the previous example of this artist’s work that had sold.},

In this study, we used social cognitive reinforcement theory, which is derived from social learning theory, to examine how the employee-organization relationship (EOR) influences managers’ knowledge-sharing behavior. We surveyed 550 frontline managers from 19 Chinese companies regarding the 2 components of EOR (expected contributions and offered inducements) and knowledge sharing. The results showed that expected contributions positively influenced knowledge sharing, and that offered inducements reinforced the relationship between the employee and the organization. Thus, compared to other approaches, a mutual investment approach, in which employers expect high levels of employee contributions and offer extensive inducements, will foster a higher level of knowledge sharing. Implications for future research are discussed.},

Furthermore, when we tested the contextual variable of parental power, we found that it moderated the 2 main effects, but in different directions. That is, the relationship between informational influence and adolescents’ proenvironmental behavior became stronger when adolescents perceived higher levels of parental power, with the opposite result with respect to normative influence.

However, Chinese people have been very reluctant to purchase EVs. In this study, I recruited a sample of 454 participants and explored which factors affect customers’ purchase intention for EVs. Results revealed that customers pay more attention to the environmental value of EVs but have fears related to electricity leakage, explosions, or radiation exposure from batteries. These findings indicate that the Chinese government’s support for EVs is still not sufficient, and that government promotion of a low-carbon lifestyle must be enhanced.},

Results showed a negative relationship between the internal social capital of the whole board and firm growth, and a positive relationship between the external social capital of inside directors and firm growth. In addition, strong ownership structure reduced the influence of the whole board’s internal social capital on firm growth. These findings imply that strong bonding among corporate directors can reduce the board’s active functioning and firm growth, but that this effect can be mitigated by strong ownership. With regard to external social capital, inside directors’ network beyond the firm boundary appears to be an effective tool to leverage firm growth.},

Compared with the low negative emotional response group, the high negative emotional response group demonstrated more prominent openness to fantasy, excitement seeking, tender-mindedness, and openness to feelings, and less prominent gregariousness, compliance, competence, deliberation, and optimism. Further, people in the high negative emotional response group tended to use the coping styles of avoiding problems, fantasizing, self-blaming, and asking for help. The traits of openness to fantasy and optimism and the coping styles of problem avoidance and self-blame predicted whether individuals experienced high or low negative emotional response.

Moreover, reduced frequency of private car use by urban residents can be better transformed into green commuting. Structural equation modeling revealed that environmental concern had a similar impact on both urban and suburban residents, but that subjective norms had a greater influence on suburban than on urban residents.

We explored lenders’ decision-making processes in online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending by drawing on trust theory and the valence framework to develop an integrated decisionmaking model, which we then tested empirically using data from a survey conducted with 474 online lenders in China. The results showed that initial trust and perceived benefit determined willingness to lend, and that the fear of borrower opportunism did not have a significant impact on this willingness. Initial trust increased willingness to lend both directly and indirectly, increased it by increasing perceived benefit. We have identified the specific features of online P2P lending and provided valuable insights for borrowers, lenders, and intermediaries.},

From monthly suicide data collected over the period from January 1981 through to December 2012, I found that suicide rates are associated with stock market returns, in aggregate. Specifically, suicide rates predicted future stock market returns, showing contemporaneous and lagged relationships with U.S. stock market returns. Furthermore, small-cap stocks were found to be more likely to be affected by suicide rates than were large-cap stocks. Female suicide rates had a stronger effect on market returns than male suicide rates did, suggesting that this suicide effect is not induced by economic reasons but, rather, is related to emotional factors (e.g., investor mood).},

The results revealed that consumer innovativeness played a generally marginal role in green product purchasing decisions, whereas public self-consciousness figured importantly in such decisions. However, public self-consciousness had no influence when products did not have logos identifying them as being green. In addition, the influence of the 2 variables on the purchasing behaviors was found to be contingent on the type of product. On the basis of these findings, we concluded that green product purchasing behaviors more closely reflect conspicuousness, rather than innovativeness.},

In our study there were 124 participants (31 Italian couples and 31 migrant couples) who completed modified versions of the Family Routine Inventory and the Family Ritual Questionnaire. Participants were contacted by teachers at kindergartens attended by the children of the couples. The results highlighted a significant difference between Italian and migrant couples in the symbolic-significance dimension of rituals.

Although product failure causes both marketers and consumers to incur substantial damage and losses, failures are often very difficult for marketers to control.

The results showed that after a product failure experience, consumers responded with the least favorable evaluation for brand-caused failure, a more favorable evaluation for natural disaster-caused failure, and the most favorable evaluation for consumer-caused failure. However, outcome severity moderated the effects: When the failure resulted in a severe outcome, positive brand evaluation deteriorated in the case of consumer-caused failure only. In addition, brand-blame attribution mediated these relationships. Our findings provide a foundation for recovery strategies in accordance with failure severity and responsible parties.},

In contrast, rational message appeals were more effective for U.S. students, and no significant differences were observed among this group regarding the in-group and out-group source cue types.

Results showed that when individuals were in a negative mood, their preference for mood repair led them to rely on the heuristic of scarcity = value inference to improve their mood. Therefore, scarcity had a positive effect on consumers’ product evaluation when they were in a negative mood. In contrast, when individuals were in a positive mood, they were motivated to retain their mood by avoiding negative events. Thus, consumers in a positive mood were more sensitive to the possibility of a scarcity claim being a sales tactic used by marketers to artificially increase demand. Further, their increased inference of scarcity claims being a sales tactic attenuated the positive effect of scarcity on their product evaluation.},

Results showed that both the guilty and nonguilty groups speedily detected crime-relevant stimuli, but the guilty group became avoidant toward these stimuli, whereas the nonguilty group did not display an avoidant pattern.},

This suggests that those experiencing positive affect made adjustments to account for the perspective of the recipient. That effect was not observed for participants experiencing a neutral mood.

Results indicated that social recognition, high involvement, and high self-efficacy resulted in more positive behavioral responses. In addition, social recognition served as a greater motivator to donate and volunteer for individuals with low cause involvement than it did for those with high involvement. Results further suggested that the positive effect of social recognition was amplified for individuals with high self-efficacy compared with those with low self-efficacy. Practical implications for the marketing of nonprofit organizations using social media are discussed.},

Results showed that nonlonely consumers preferred products with high, vs. low or medium, anthropomorphism. However, the relationship between the favorite products of lonely consumers and anthropomorphic degree presented as an inverted U-shaped curve. In Study 2, I recruited 553 participants to extend Study 1 and investigate the moderating role of product category on the loneliness–anthropomorphism preference relationship. Results demonstrated that lonely people preferred hedonic products with high anthropomorphism and utilitarian products with low anthropomorphism above all others.

Much research has been conducted on the effect of popularity among children and adolescents, but the popularity of adults at work has received little attention. I investigated the effects of employees’ popularity on their career satisfaction, and, in regard to this relationship, the roles of employees’ knowledge, skill, and abilities (KSA) as moderators, and of their core self-evaluations as a mediator. Participants were 219 supervisor–subordinate dyads employed by 32 enterprises in China. Multiple regression analysis of the data showed that the employees’ popularity was positively related to their career satisfaction. Their KSA level moderated this relationship, so that, among employees with less KSA, popularity had a stronger effect on their career satisfaction than among those with more KSA. Employees’ core self-evaluations fully mediated the moderating effect of KSA on the relationship between popularity and career satisfaction. The findings suggest that if employees can increase their popularity, this is an effective way to improve their career satisfaction, especially for those who are low in KSA. Improvement of employees’ core self-evaluations may also directly enhance their career satisfaction.},

I explored the psychological mechanism underlying the exchanging of sex for tangible benefits such as drugs, money, and career opportunities, that is, transactional sex. I conducted an experiment with 58 undergraduate students at a university in China. I found that objectification (i.e., viewing human beings and objects as alike) moderated the effect of materialism on their attitudes toward transactional sex. When primed with materialistic images, individuals who saw a larger overlap between the attributes of human beings and objects, and those who perceived themselves as more object-like, felt more positive toward transactional sex than did those less prone to objectify the self and others. This study contributes to understanding of transactional sex, which temporarily satisfies individuals’ material needs yet may have disastrous consequences in multiple life domains. Therefore, in addition to advancing knowledge about materialism and objectification, an understanding of the psychological mechanism underlying transactional sex may potentially contribute to the well-being of those who are most likely to participate in transactional sex.},

There is a growing number of older individuals seeking entry-level public service positions; jobs that may not be physically demanding, but may require emotional exertion. Older individuals are more experienced in interpersonal interactions and may be able to manage their emotions better than can their younger counterparts. However, factors of age and performance of work requiring emotional labor are lacking in public administration research. I conducted a survey with 167 public-service employees in USA, classifying them as younger adults (25 to 44 years old) and older adults (45 to 65 years old), and examined how performance of work requiring emotional labor mediates employee age by using an individual’s pride in their job as a criterion variable. The findings suggested that an employee’s age was positively related to pride in the job and better performance of work requiring emotional labor, and, unless they are mediated by higher level of false face acting, these two variables are significantly related. These findings lead to several suggestions for organizations: first, that public service organizations should open up work opportunities to older individuals; and second, because of lower wages in the public sector, organizations should offer generous fringe benefits.},

We examined the mediating role of social support in the relationship between shyness and loneliness among 618 Chinese adolescents, by administering the Revised Cheek and Buss Shyness Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and UCLA Loneliness Scale (Version 3). The results showed that a higher level of shyness was associated with a lower level of social support and a higher level of loneliness, and loneliness was negatively correlated with social support. The mediation analysis result indicated that social support partially mediated the relationship between shyness and loneliness. Thus, reducing shy feelings and enhancing social support may be preventive measures to help relieve adolescents’ feelings of loneliness.},

We investigated whether making the product offered as a free gift also available for sale by itself (i.e., a stand-alone sale of the gift product) accentuated the customer’s perception of the value of the promotion. Previous research on value anchoring and adjustment predicted that a stand-alone sale of a gift would increase the promotion value, whereas the opposite was predicted in the scarcity perception literature. We conducted 3 empirical studies with 330 undergraduate students in Korea, and the results supported the scarcity hypothesis: The availability of a stand-alone sale decreased the perceived scarcity of a free gift which, in turn, reduced the value of the promotional offer and discouraged our participants from joining the promotion program. Our findings suggest that the effectiveness of a free gift promotion is enhanced when the gift is not available as a stand-alone product.},

The results demonstrate that cart abandonment was directly and positively influenced by organization and research of the products within the cart as well as by comparison with external websites, and was directly and negatively influenced by payment intention. Both perceived cost and perceived risk had an indirect effect on cart abandonment through the mediator of organization and research of products within the cart.

Our results provide the first evidence for an application of the IAT in research focused on materialism and postmaterialism. We found that implicit postmaterialism significantly predicted proenvironmental behavioral intention in a Chinese context, and implicit materialism was a strong predictor of actual proenvironmental behaviors (i.e., avoidance of paper waste). These results indicate that, for Chinese people, materialism is an important motivation for their actual proenvironmental behaviors.},

  abstract = {© Society for Personality Research. We examined the impact of a ubiquitous mentoring program on self-esteem, school adaptation flexibility, and perception of parental attitude toward child rearing of elementary students from low socioeconomic status families. We selected 23 elementary-school students whom we had identified as high-risk and each student was paired with a trained mentor for 20 sessions of a mentoring program. Ubiquitous mentoring significantly changed the students’ perception of parental attitudes about child rearing and their perception of parents using democratic and authoritative styles of parenting had increased after 20 weeks of mentoring. Social self-esteem rapidly declined from baseline to the 20th week and an increase in family self-esteem was noted on the 20th week of the program. A rapid decline in school adaptation flexibility was noted from baseline to the end of the mentoring program. The data indicate that a ubiquitous mentoring program can serve as a support system for vulnerable children. We found that outcomes were greatly influenced by the length and quality of the mentoring and these factors should be considered as topics for future study.},

Results of hierarchical linear modeling analysis of data collected from 33 work groups at 5 state-owned manufacturing factories in China supported our hypotheses.

We suggested that, from the organizational learning and dynamic capability perspective, the construct of knowledge assets should cover the organization’s learning capability, accumulated through social interaction within and outside the organizational boundary. In our proposed model, social capital provides an infrastructure for knowledge creation, and learning capability measured knowledge creation and exchange activities. Indicators of social capital and learning capability are suggested, and implications and limitations of this study are discussed.},

Results of Experiment 1 indicated that the latency of the unattractive faces with words indicating trust or attractive faces with words indicating distrust (incompatible group) was twice as long as that of the attractive faces with trust words or unattractive faces with distrust words (compatible group). In Experiment 2, we used an investment game to measure individuals’ explicit trusting behavior and found that participants gave significantly more money to attractive partners than they did to unattractive partners.

Specifically, internal causes that related to the game outcome (e.g., internal control and stability) had a significant positive impact on their feelings of pride and a significant negative effect on their shame, whereas external control had a significant positive impact on their anger and a significant negative effect on their feelings of gratitude. Thus, both internal control and stability appeared to be the most influential causal attribution dimensions in predicting consumer satisfaction with the outcome of a game.

These results indicate the benefits associated with teachers’ impressions of personnel officials’ authentic emotional displays. Therefore, emotional authenticity might be important for an individual’s ability to understand another’s personal identity.},

We found that, even with gender, education, and position taken into account, the Millennial generation placed more importance on intrinsic and extrinsic rewards than did the Transitional generation or the Cultural Revolution generation, and that the Cultural Revolution generation placed more importance on altruism than did the younger generations. Results also showed that generation exerted more influence on work values than did age. This implies that, taking these results into account, current human resource management practices in organizations and institutions in China should be adjusted accordingly.},

Participants were 750 fifth- and sixth-grade elementary school students. We developed the scale through a series of analyses, including item analysis, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, simultaneous multigroup covariance analysis, and criterionrelated validity analysis. The CSLCS comprises 12 items, of which 6 items measure ability and responsibility in the internal control dimension, and 6 items measure environment and chance in the external control dimension. The results of the analyses confirmed that this scale has good reliability, validity, and measurement invariance, and that it also satisfies all fit measures. The 6 measures of internal locus of control in the CSLCS are suited for measuring children’s sport locus of control, and the measurement results will not differ across gender. Finally, we offer suggestions to future researchers.},

We investigated the effects of 2 dimensions of affect in evaluative conditioning (EC) on changing alcohol-related attitudes in a sample of students whom we had identified as fitting set criteria to be classified as heavy drinkers. We divided participants into 2 EC groups (high-arousal EC condition, n = 18; low-arousal EC condition, n = 18) and measured their explicit and implicit attitudes toward alcohol. Comparison of results before and after EC indicated that participants reported a greater decrease in both explicit attitudes about positive alcohol expectancies and explicit cravings. However, in regard to implicit attitudes, the results showed that the high-arousal EC condition was associated with a stronger positive attitude toward alcohol after, rather than before, EC, whereas in the low-arousal EC group, implicit attitudes toward alcohol did not change. These results imply that high levels of affect arousal during EC can positively strengthen the implicit evaluation of alcohol in a student sample of heavy drinkers, while decreasing explicit attitudes about cravings and positive expectancies. Thus, based on attitude conditioning, it is important to consider the arousal as well as the valence of affect in treatment of alcohol addiction in order to change alcohol-related attitudes in heavy drinkers.},

  abstract = {© Society for Personality Research. The Synthetic House–Tree–Person Test (S-HTP Test; Mikami, 1995), which is a projective technique used in clinical psychology, is based on Buck’s (1948) House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test. In the original HTP Test, children were asked to draw a house, a tree, and a person, each on a separate piece of paper, and the drawings were then used to project psychological features, such as personality. The S-HTP Test differs from the original test in that all items are drawn on a single sheet of paper. The overview in this study was of the features of human figures drawn by Japanese junior high school students during an S-HTP Test. We focused, in particular, on the relationships between the human figures, and gender differences. We predicted that human relationships depicted in the S-HTP Test could be used to project the nature of the participants’ actual relationships, and that there would be a significant gender difference. To verify the features of the drawings according to the artist’s gender, the percentage of relationships between human figures drawn during the S-HTP Test was examined using Pearson’s chi-squared test. The results showed a significant gender-based difference, x2(1) = 7.85, p < .01, with a higher percentage of the girls depicting relationships in their drawings, compared to the boys. When Ochiai and Sato (1996) examined gender differences in friendship styles among Japanese adolescents, they found that self-disclosure and efforts made to understand one another were significantly higher in female adolescents. Ochiai and Sato inferred from this finding that female junior high school students are more sensitive to relationships than are male students. This trait no doubt influenced the percentage of relationships between human figures drawn by the girls in our study. The S-HTP Test is thus an important diagnostic tool for psychological assessment. Therefore, it is necessary that researchers examine its utility in detail, in future developmental and cross-cultural studies. We plan to continue to add data in our research, because our findings in this study were based on a limited sample.},

We conducted two studies with university students as participants. We used different measures of EOC; in the first study we measured general sense of power and in the second we primed power.

In Study 1, with 86 participants, we found that individuals with a high need for uniqueness were less likely to purchase brands used by the majority of members of an in-group when the group was homogeneous and the product was identity relevant because of their need for arousal of differentiation under these conditions. In Study 2, we temporarily primed need states of 93 participants and results supported the relationships we had observed in Study 1.

Results showed that temporal distance did not have a significant influence on the assessment of the severity of water pollution, whereas probability and social distance did. In Study 2, 146 participants evaluated the severity of water pollution in three 2 × 2 designs and one 2 × 2 × 2 design. Results demonstrated that, when the 3 psychological distances coexisted, the main effect of probability distance on severity assessment was significant, but neither temporal nor social distance had a significant effect. © Society for Personality Research.},

Furthermore, price perception, i.e., players' views of value as measured against cost, also influenced their purchase intention. Therefore, we determined that flow and price perception significantly enhance purchase intention.

According to structural equation modeling, the 3 following approaches should be involved in, and may improve, the effectiveness of dealing with incompetent teachers: minimizing the difference in principals' and teachers' attitude toward dealing with incompetent teachers; ensuring that there is fairness in the workload allocation for incompetent teachers; and increasing teachers' satisfaction with the approaches used for dealing with incompetent teachers.

However, little is known about why people continue to use the service. We built an integrated model applicable for use within the social network context. We based this study on an expectation confirmation model (ECM) and related technology adoption literature, and examined data from a random survey of 205 users. The results indicated that the direct path between perceived usefulness and continuance intention and satisfaction was nonsignificant but that perceived playfulness exerted a significant influence on satisfaction and continuance intention. In addition, users' satisfaction was influenced not only by confirmation but also by perceived playfulness. In contrast, privacy concerns did not seem to influence the direct path between satisfaction and continuance intention. Usage frequency was an important indicator in determining user continuance intention. Overall, we found that an integrated model of the ECM had a better explanatory power of Facebook check-in service continuance compared to the ECM by itself.},

They completed anonymous questionnaires regarding peer attachment (the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment-Revised), personality (the Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire), and loneliness (the Loneliness and Social Dissatisfaction Questionnaire). The results showed that extraversion moderated the relationship between peer attachment and loneliness, but neither neuroticism nor psychoticism had a moderating effect. Specifically, peer attachment predicted loneliness more strongly for highly extraverted adolescents than for their introverted peers. These findings illustrate that the effects of peer attachment on a subjective mental state varied considerably across this group of adolescents who were deaf, depending on the level of extraversion of each individual.},

We, therefore, conducted this study to examine the impact on the proposer's decision in the UG when information was obtained about the responded minimum acceptable offer (MAO). The results show that a high percentage of the proposer's offers were close to the MAO, indicating that fear of rejection for fairness, accounted for the proposer's positive offer. We also found that Machiavellian personality traits played an important role in the proposer's offering behavior. This indicated that fear of rejection may be more prominently displayed by people scoring highly in Machiavellianism.},

Scanning electron microscopy results showed that provision of high-quality services for older adult consumers in a sport and fitness center elevated perceived value, enhanced customer satisfaction, reduced complaint behavior, and ultimately increased the likelihood of renewed membership and continued use of the center facilities.},

In this study we examined overoptimistic prediction as a function of construal level. In construal level theory an explanation is set out with regard to how people make predictions through the abstract connections between past and future events, with high-level construal bridging near and distant events. We conducted 2 experiments to confirm our hypothesis that, compared with people with local, concrete construals, people with global, abstract construals would make predictions that were less overoptimistic. In Study 1 we manipulated construal level by priming mindset, and participants (n = 81) predicted the level of their productivity in an anagram task. The results supported our hypothesis. In Study 2, in order to improve the generalizability of the conclusion, we varied the manipulation of the construal level by priming a scenario, and measured performance prediction by having the participants (n = 119) estimate task duration. The results showed that high-level construal consistently decreased overoptimistic prediction, supporting our hypothesis. The theoretical implications of our findings are discussed.},

We used conservation of resources (COR) theory (Hobfoll, 1989) as a basis for our examination of the impact of role conflict on middle managers' job satisfaction and work-related anxiety, and the buffering effect of proactive personality. Participants comprised 245 middle managers. The results showed that more role conflict did not significantly lead to lower job satisfaction, but led to significantly higher work-related anxiety. We also found that proactive personality significantly moderated the relationships between role conflict and the two outcome variables. Specifically, for more proactive middle managers, role conflict did not significantly influence either job satisfaction or work-related anxiety. However, for less proactive middle managers, more role conflict led to significantly lower job satisfaction and higher work-related anxiety. This suggests that proactive personality can serve as a coping resource that buffers the dysfunctional effects of role conflict.

The results indicated that, compared with those in the strong group, the weak group tended to elevate the likelihood of success based on the assigned probability of others.

Our aim was to identify which element in the reasoning process fails and thus underlies the heuristic bias in children's reasoning in the personal domain. We explored the probability of judging violation among this group of children in reasoning tasks involving personal domain rules and by measuring their lexical decision times. The results showed that the heuristic bias in children's reasoning in the personal domain was caused by monitoring failure among those who were of junior school age and by inhibition failure among those who were of middle school age. As most of the children of senior school age were able to complete the inhibition process, they had less heuristic bias.},

In the present study we examined how public or private context influences subsequent licensing and compensatory behavior. An online survey was administered to 99 undergraduates who were asked to recall moral credentials or deficits and then evaluate vignettes depicting public or private transgressions. Consistent with past research, credentialed participants were significantly more likely to behave unethically than were participants with moral deficits. However, this licensing effect occurred only for private transgressions and was absent when behavior was public. Our findings suggest that prior establishment of credentials and private context are both prerequisites to the moral licensing effect.},

The results showed that when lives at risk were interpreted as relatives or friends of the decision makers, the effect of framing on an individual's risk preference was weakened and no framing effect occurred. In contrast, when the individuals whose lives were at risk were interpreted to be unrelated to the decision makers, framing played an obvious role and a framing effect occurred. Social cues were found to influence the occurrence of framing effect.},

We developed the self-reported Social Loafing Tendency Questionnaire (SLTQ) to measure individual variations in social loafing. In Study 1, the reliability and validity of the SLTQ were established in a sample of college students. In Study 2, SLTQ scores significantly negatively predicted individual performance in the group task condition, but not in the individual task condition. Social loafing can also be considered a trait variable, as it was found to modulate group dynamics when it was activated in a typical situation (i.e., being in a group).},

When I considered the components of savoring, I found that WFC was also negatively associated with savoring the moment, but not associated with savoring through anticipation and savoring through reminiscence. I have contributed to the literature by presenting empirical evidence supporting the impact on WFC of individuals' beliefs about their ability to savor positive circumstances. © Society for Personality Research.},

Participants completed the Chinese version of the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Chinese General Health Questionnaire. Results revealed that those who perceived themselves to have good financial status reported higher LS and sense of adequacy, and lower anxiety than did those who did not. In addition, LS was significantly correlated with MH, and sense of adequacy was the strongest psychological predictor of LS. These findings suggest that LS and MH are directly associated with perceived financial status, and MH may mediate or moderate the association between PFS and LS. © Society for Personality Research.},

We found that although money-primed reactance in control trials in which the majority provided correct responses, this effect vanished in critical trials in which the majority provided incorrect answers.

However, we found a gender-based difference in response according to visual stimulus: the more positive the attitude toward visual stimuli, the stronger the response to other components. Based on these findings, implications for blog design and satisfaction are discussed. © Society for Personality Research.},

We performed multivariate analysis and found that better social support, better personal mastery, normal sleep duration, no current tobacco use, and eating breakfast daily or almost daily were associated with happiness. The findings partially confirmed the association between happiness and several health behaviors mediated by social factors.

In a series of virtual laboratory (e-lab) experiments in which participants were either simply exposed to choice dilemmas and opinion items or presented with a persuasive argument about each of them, I found that there was a lower level of cross-cultural differences in internalization than in compliance.

However, most research on this topic has been conducted with adolescents and adults. Thus, in the present case study our aim was to investigate the relationship between age and FLL anxiety with children aged between 10 to 14 years. We used both qualitative and quantitative research methods for triangulation. We collected data via a questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha.876), adapted from Horwitz, Horwitz, and Cope (1986) and via interviews with 84 children at a state primary school in Turkey. In addition to calculating means and standard deviations, we used Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests for dual and multiple comparisons. The results suggested that there were no statistically significant differences according to gender and that the younger children in the study were less anxious than the older children about FLL.

  title = {Informal workplace family support and turnover intention: Testing a mediation model},
  author = {Ahmad, Aminah and Omar, Zoharah},
  year = {2013-05-28},

  abstract = {Compared with employees who work in an environment perceived as providing little family support, research findings show that those who work in an environment with strong family support report less work-family conflict (Lapierre et al., 2008), lower levels of job stress (Bozo, Toksabay, & Kürüm, 2009) and of turnover intention (Aminah & Zoharah, 2010). Employees who experience high levels of work-family conflict have also reported high levels of job stress (Kreiner, 2006) and increased intention to leave the organization (Pasewark & Viator, 2006). Despite the importance and outcomes of family support in the workplace, few researchers have examined informal support and the mediating roles of work-family conflict and job stress in the supportturnover relationship. In our study we tested a model grounded in theories of conservation of resource (Hobfoll, 1989), social exchange (Blau, 1964), and organizational support (Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison, & Sowa, 1986), and based on results of previous studies. Informal workplace family support was our independent variable, the dependent variable was employee turnover intention, and work-family conflict and job stress were the mediating variables. Using structural equation modeling we tested the responses of 616 employees (age: M = 34.81 years; gender: 53.7% female) to self-administered questionnaires. We computed the mean scores of the variables on a 5-point scale (informal workplace family support: M = 3.41; work-family conflict: M = 2.67; job stress: M = 2.42; turnover intention: M = 2.63). Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients (.78 -.94) for all variables indicated good internal consistency. The average variance extracted values (AVE;.511 -.596) suggested high convergent validity. Consistent with the literature, the results showed significant effects of informal workplace family support on turnover intention (β = -.131, p <.0001), work-family conflict (β = -.131, p <.0001) and job stress (β = -.083, p <.05). There were significant effects of work-family conflict on job stress (β =.674, p <.0001) and turnover intention (β =.247, p <.0001), and a significant effect of job stress on turnover intention (β =.344, p <.0001). Results of the tested mediation model showed that the direct influence of informal workplace family support on turnover intention became nonsignificant (β = -.029, p =.515), suggesting that work-family conflict and job stress fully mediated the influence of informal work-family support on turnover intention. The model fit indices of goodness of fit (GFI =.929), incremental fit (IFI =.943), Tucker-Lewis (TLI =.931), comparative fit (CFI =.943), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA =.062; χ2/df = 3.38) were acceptable. Informal workplace family support, work-family conflict and job stress explained 30% of the variance in turnover intention. The results suggest that when organizations provide their employees with informal workplace family support, such as greater discretion to manage their work, and permission to leave work earlier than usual to attend to family matters, these provisions help reduce employees' work-family conflict, which, in turn, reduces both their job stress and turnover intention. We concluded that informal workplace family support is a potential resource for reducing employee turnover, and that work-family conflict and job stress play important mediating roles in this support-turnover relationship. © Society for Personality Research.},

  abstract = {Of the currently limited available data on the mental health of students in Ireland the most notable are provided in the College Lifestyle and Attitudinal National (CLAN) Survey (Hope, Dring, & Dring, 2005). Recently, Houghton et al. (2012) found among students at an Irish university that women reported significantly higher levels of symptomatology than men on each of the three 6-item subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI 18; Derogatis, 2001) (anxiety, depression, and somatization) and the Global Severity Index (GSI; summed total of the 18 items). Similarly, final-year students had significantly worse mental health than non-final-year students. Internal reliability, construct validity, and factor structure of the BSI 18, were reported but no data on the test-retest reliability of the measure. Our aim was to supplement these findings by reporting on the test-retest reliability of the BSI 18 in a small sample of Irish college students. On two occasions, separated by four weeks, 28 Irish college students completed the BSI 18. Satisfactory levels of internal reliability (>.7; Cronbach's α) were found for the depression (Time 1 α =.76, Time 2 α =.70), and anxiety (Time 1 α =.82, Time 2 α =.75) subscales, and the GSI (Time 1 α =.87, Time 2 α =.86), with the exception being somatization (Time 1 α =.52, Time 2 α =.76). At both administrations, scores on each measure were highly associated (somatization r =.50, p <.01; depression r =.44, p <.05; anxiety r =.59, p <.001; GSI r =.52, p <.001) and no significant difference in scores was found (somatization Time 1 M = 3.92 (2.69), Time 2 M = 3.55 (3.60), t =.57, p >.05; depression Time 1 M = 2.93 (2.89), Time 2 M = 2.89 (3.13), t =.06, p >.05; anxiety Time 1 M = 3.79 (4.24), Time 2 M = 3.25 (3.23), t =.87, p >.05; GSI Time 1 M = 10.64 (8.59), Time 2 M = 9.68 (8.40), t =.60, p >.05). These data provide evidence for the internal reliability and temporal stability of the three subscales of the BSI 18 (anxiety, depression, and somatization) and the GSI over a 4-week period among a sample of Irish college students. These findings are in line with those reported across a range of samples and countries (e.g., Andreu et al., 2008; Coutinho, Ferreirinha, & Ribeiro, 2010). Although the generalizability of these findings is limited owing to the small sample size, the selectivity of the sample (i.e., college students, mainly women), and the small length of the testing period (i.e., four weeks), the BSI 18 was found to be temporally stable. These findings also provide additional psychometric evidence that attests to the reliability of the measures within Ireland. The BSI 18 can be commended as a tool for further research among college students in Ireland. © Society for Personality Research.},

Our results show that stereotypes of deceptive behaviors exist in both cultures with cross-cultural consistency. However, we also found that the deception stereotype was significantly different in these two cultures and was also different according to gender. Our findings support and validate the GDRT's findings with a deeper and more detailed analysis. © Society for Personality Research.},

We used sociodemographic variables as well as collectivistic values, clinical symptoms, command of the German language, perceived social support, and self-efficacy as possible predictors of unemployment. Logistic regression revealed that attending a training course, previous work experience, and a shorter time in Austria increased chances of employment. The logistic regression model we presented will enable practitioners to predict chances of employment in individual cases and to tailor refugees' vocational rehabilitation to their personal needs. The results suggest that vocational rehabilitation for refugees should be provided as soon as possible after asylum has been granted. © Society for Personality Research.},

An implication of Trope's (1986) dual process model of social information processing is that this may not be so when interpersonal transgressions are ambiguous. In such cases, full apologies primarily serve to identify behaviors as affronts. In Study 1, participants read vignettes involving clear or ambiguous transgressions for which 1 of 3 alternative forms of apology were received by the wronged person: no apology, a full apology, or an expression of sympathy offered as partial apology. For clear transgressions, participants expected full apologies to soothe the wronged person more than either partial apologies or no apologies, but when transgressions were ambiguous, full apologies were considered to be less likely to ameliorate the wronged person's bad feelings than were partial apologies. In Study 2 we replicated the effect for ambiguous transgressions even when participants had the vignette presented to them as if they were in the role of the wronged person, and the results of Study 3 indicate that these findings are not an artifact of differences in conclusions about whether a transgression had actually taken place. Reactions to apologies are an interactive effect of the nature of the apology and the nature of the transgression. © Society for Personality Research.},

Internal consistency reliability for the subscales was established (Cronbach's alpha =.817,.852,.832, and.861, respectively). Moderate correlations were found between all subscales, eating pathology, and impulsive control. Positive emotion and negative emotion were found to play an important role in eating behavior.

We investigated the potential relationship between cognitive style and the occurrence of these diseases. A total of 75 undergraduate students completed the Kirton Adaption-Innovation Inventory (KAI; Kirton, 1976), a measure of cognitive style, and the Health Personality Test (HPT), a measure of proneness to cancer and coronary heart disease. The hypothesis that cancer proneness would be related to adaption and coronary heart disease proneness would be related to innovation was supported. This suggests that the KAI could potentially be used for the prospective identification of disease-susceptible individuals. © Society for Personality Research.},

The results showed that positive thinking was the coping strategy that the participants used most often when they were experiencing foreign language learning anxiety. Use of the coping strategy of positive thinking was also the strongest predictor of all coping variables of a lower level of foreign language learning anxiety. The results also revealed that resignation contributed to higher levels of foreign language learning anxiety than did use of other coping strategies.

  abstract = {Conditions of uncertainty and anxiety are thought to provide fertile ground for paranormal beliefs to take root and flourish (Shermer, 2011). Few researchers have examined the condition of uncertainty, and, specifically, the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and paranormal beliefs. The purpose in this study was to address this notable omission in the literature. The Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS; Freeston, Rhéaume, Letarte, Dugas, & Ladouceur, 1994) was used to measure the degree to which a person tolerates uncertainty. The Paranormal Belief Scale (PBS; Tobacyk & Milford, 1983) was used to measure a person's tendency to hold paranormal beliefs. Three hypotheses were proposed: Hypothesis 1: There will be a positive correlation between scores on the IUS and the PBS. Hypothesis 2: There will be a positive correlation between IUS scores and traditional religious beliefs (PBS, subscale one). Hypothesis 3: There will be a positive correlation between IUS scores and precognition (PBS, subscale seven). Participants (N = 183; 103 women and 80 men) were recruited from introductory psychology courses at a medium-sized liberal arts university in the USA. Participants completed a packet of self-report measures, including the IUS (α =.872) and the PBS (α =.88). As we predicted, a simple correlation analysis revealed that IUS composite scores did correlate with PBS scores (H1: r =.15, p <.05). Additional simple correlations were performed between the IUS and the seven subscales of the PBS. These analyses failed to reveal the predicted relationship between IUS and traditional religious beliefs (PBS, subscale one; H2: r =.07, p >.05), but did reveal the predicted relationship between IUS and precognition (PBS, subscale 7; H3: r =.22, p <.01). The results suggest that intolerance of uncertainty appears to be associated with paranormal beliefs in general and beliefs in precognition more specifically. Future researchers should address the limitations in this study by drawing participants from different populations (e. g., noncollege-aged individuals) and through the use of experimental designs that might shed light on a possible causal relationship between the constructs. Nevertheless, the results of this study represent an important first step in this process by finding that people high in intolerance of uncertainty may gravitate toward paranormal explanations of events, as any explanation may be better than no explanation. © Society for Personality Research.},

The findings indicated that consumers perceiving the company as both socially and temporally close evaluated it more favorably when ambivalence concerned morality. However, when 1 or more dimensions of psychological distance extended, consumers tended to evaluate the company more favorably when the source of ambivalence concerned competence. These findings suggest that consumer evaluations of a company are influenced by not only which aspect of company behavior is ambivalent, but also by whether or not it is a single dimension or multiple dimensions of psychological distance being considered. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. © Society for Personality Research.},

Collectivism most strongly correlated with OCB motivated by concern for coworkers. A concept of self as one who helps others at work was also associated with collectivism. Individualism was associated more with a commitment to the well-being of the institution per se rather than to its employees. Individualism and collectivism were related positively, suggesting that these seemingly opposing attributes are complementary; which of these traits predominates may depend on which citizenship behavior is needed at a given time. Overall, the findings suggest that it is not in amount of citizenship that individualists and collectivists differ, but in why they serve and how they perceive the experience. © Society for Personality Research.},

When the future possibility of zero gain was explicitly cued in the present option, this reminded participants of the chance of future loss and eliminated the differences in temporal preferences between those with high and low FTP. In contrast, present zero gain cued in the future option neither raised the participants' consideration of possible present loss nor changed their temporal preference. Possible future losses were determined to be chronically salient in high FTP participants and situationally salient in conditions in which future zero was explicitly cued.

The predictivity of the added psychological separation variable on career self-efficacy at the second level also reached significance after controlling for the mother-daughter attachment relationship. Additionally, the communication of the attachment relationship and the functional independence and conflictual independence of psychological separation were significant predictors. This suggests that people who a) communicate well with their mothers and who are able to manage personal matters without help from mothers, or b) have conflictual relationships with their mothers that lead to negative emotions, have better career self-efficacy. © Society for Personality Research.},

Results showed that the main difference between the 2 groups was that whereas Burmese Chinese tend to shun conflict and may even submit to their opponent to prevent a conflict from escalating, Taiwanese are less likely to employ an accommodation strategy. The conclusion was reached that in a task-oriented or relationship conflict, in a business situation Taiwanese and Burmese Chinese people differ significantly in their use of collaboration, accommodation, and withdrawal as negotiation styles. © Society for Personality Research.},

Boys scored higher than girls in the felt lonely and asking for help items in the second week, while girls scored higher than boys in the sensitive, depressed, self-blaming, and rationalization items 1 year after the earthquake.

We found that a promotion offering a combination of high-value prizes plus some low-value prizes was invariably preferred over a promotion offering only high- or low-value prizes. We also explored whether these high- or low-value prizes should be in a series of ascending value or prizes at each value level should be of the same value and whether or not some moderately valuable prizes should also be included. © Society for Personality.},

The analysis of data collected from 148 individuals who completed 2 sets of creativity tasks under different task conditions revealed that task autonomy reduces creative performance when there is no prior task-relevant experience. Individuals with high self-control showed similar levels of creativity regardless of the level of task autonomy. In contrast, those with low self-control performed more creatively under a no autonomy condition than under an autonomy condition.

PTSD occurred more frequently among females compared with males, and among those exposed directly, indirectly, or not at all to the earthquake, the highest incidence of PTSD was among the group exposed directly. Among 3 groups aged between 11 and 13, 14 and 15, and 16 and 18, the highest incidence of PTSD was in students aged 14 and 15. Compared with other groups those with the highest incidence of PTSD were students with low socioeconomic status, who witnessed the earthquake, had heavy loss of their houses and other possessions, and whose family members were casualties. Factor analysis showed that the 3-factor model of the PCL-C had good construct validity. The internal consistency of Cronbach's alpha and split-half reliability was also satisfactory.

A Chinese version (Wang, Wang, & Mahong, 1999) of the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Ward, & Mendelson, 1961) was used to determine depressive symptoms; participants who scored 5 or higher were assigned to the subthreshold depression group and were invited to be tested on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (Patton, Stanford, & Barratt, 1995) and on the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry, 1992). Results showed that moderate depression was prevalent among Chinese university students; in particular, students with higher scores for impulsivity, physical aggression, and verbal aggression were susceptible to depression. Verbal aggression correlated with depressive scores, but this relationship was strong only among female participants (r =.985, p <.05). © Society for Personality Research.},

Tibetan students were found to have higher levels of negative emotional expressivity in comparison to Han, Uighur, Hui, and Mongolian students. Han students reported a higher level of emotion regulation than students from ethnic groups. Minority students, especially those of Tibetan ethnicity, reported a significantly higher level of negative mood than Han students. Together, these findings suggest that minority students experience more negative emotion and are less likely to adopt emotion regulation strategies than Han students.

The aim in this study was to assess HIV patients' HRQoL, clinical, psychosocial, and sociodemographic factors at 3 public hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa over 20 months. Patients (N = 735) who attended 3 HIV clinics completed interview assessments prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy; 519 after 6 months, 557 after 12, and 499 after 20 months on ART. Results indicate that total HRQoL increased, as did general quality of life, general health, independence, social relationships, and environment. HIV symptoms, depression symptom ratings, and internalized stigma reduced over time, whereas CD4 cell counts (number of helper T cells per cubic milliliter of blood), adherence to ART, and social support increased. Total HRQoL, the physical and psychological HRQoL domains, and internalized stigma improved at first and then deteriorated almost to baseline levels. Significant independent predictors of good HRQoL were low internalized stigma, being employed, earning wages, higher CD4 cell counts, and fewer and less severe HIV and depressive symptoms. In order to maximize gains in HRQoL for patients on ART, interventions are needed that address and reduce stigmatization and enhance the economic and employment opportunities. © Society for Personality Research.},

Our regression results showed that an employee's collectivism was positively associated with his/her OCBs. Contrary to our prediction, however, collectivism was also positively related to IMBs.

Specifically, it was proposed that TPB-based psychological mechanisms (attitude toward creativity, creative self-efficacy, and creativity intention) would mediate the effects of contextual factors (leader encouragement and peer support) on individual creative performance. Multisource data collected at 3 time points from 386 students and their 28 instructors largely supported the hypothesized mediating role of creative self-efficacy.

Only those participants who had been traumatized benefited from the intervention. For the traumatized subsample, sponsorship led to a significant and stable decrease in anxiety, depression, and psychological problems as compared to the control group, with effect sizes comparable to those of psychotherapy. As the effects were palliative rather than instrumental, sponsorship did not instigate improvements in acculturation, societal contact, or coping capability. Women benefited from the intervention more than men, and Afghans benefited more than Chechens. © Society for Personality Research.},

Following Gottfredson's (1981, 2002) theory of circumscription and compromise, in which it is proposed that occupational aspirations originate in the preschool years, in this study the occupational aspirations of 1,044 preschool children in Taiwan were explored. Children who attended 38 kindergartens and were between the ages of 5 and 6, expressed their preferences about and gender orientations towards occupations and careers. In general, the occupations Taiwanese children said they most desired to pursue were teaching, being police officers, and working as doctors. Most children can recognize the occupations of their parents at this stage, and the results in this research show that children still identify strongly with their parents' stereotypical occupations. More boys than girls showed a preference for masculine-dominated occupations. More girls than boys showed a preference for nontraditional occupations. Factors that influence occupational aspirations were found to be parental identification and identifying with the role of teachers. © Society for Personality Research.},

The results show that contemporary teachers have more education, are younger, and tend to focus on urbanized job searches through formal channels, such as newspapers, network bulletins, posters, and human resource banks. The extent of understanding the prospective job is a primary factor in predicting teachers' performance and satisfaction, which can decrease teachers' turnover intentions. Teachers recruited through formal channels had higher turnover intentions; however, their job performances showed no significant differences compared to informal channels, which suggests that understanding a prospective job can predict teachers' performance, satisfaction, and turnover intentions.

  abstract = {There is a growing body of evidence from developing countries which suggests there is an association between poverty and risk of common mental disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Patel & Kleinman, 2003). With respect to the mechanisms underlying this relationship, it is far from clear whether poverty exerts a direct influence on PTSD outcomes (i.e., over and above individual factors such as trauma exposure) as suggested by some researchers (Rockers, Kruk, Saydee, Varpilah, & Galea, 2010) or poverty is a risk factor for traumatic experiences (Townsend & Dawes, 2004), with such traumatic experiences in turn serving as determinants of PTSD. Attempting to obtain further clarity on this poverty-risk relationship, and with specific reference to child sexual abuse experiences (CSA), during 2010 I surveyed 323 South African undergraduate students (age: M= 20.14 years; gender: 71% female; ethnicity: 87% Black African). Poverty and CSA were assessed using the poverty and sexual abuse scales of the Developmental Trauma Inventory designed by Valjee and Collings (2010), who reported high test-retest reliability for the CSA (r= .98, p < .001) and poverty (r= .97, p < .001) subscales at 2 weeks, with construct validity being demonstrated by high correlations with other measures of CSA and with structural measures of poverty, respectively. PTSD was assessed using the Davidson Trauma Scale (Davidson, 2003). Davidson reported high test-retest reliability for the scale within a 1-week period (r= .86, p= .001), with construct validity being demonstrated by high correlations with other measures of PTSD.Zero-order correlations indicated that poverty scores were significantly correlated with both CSA (r= 0.20, p < .001) and PTSD scores (r= 0.12, p < .05), with CSA being significantly correlated with PTSD scores (r= 0.15, p < .01). A path analysis in which poverty was considered as an antecedent variable, CSA exposure as a potential mediating variable, and PTSD scores as an outcome variable, produced significant path coefficients for poverty and CSA (r= 0.22, p < .001) and for CSA and PTSD scores (r= 0.18, p < .01), but no significant coefficient for poverty and PTSD scores (r= 0.08, p= .118). Taken together, these findings are consistent with the view that poverty constitutes a risk factor for CSA (Townsend & Dawes, 2004), and suggest that CSA experiences may mediate the relationship between poverty and PTSD outcomes. © Society for Personality Research.},

Therefore, MTL is an important determinant of leadership emergence in autonomous work teams. With a sample of 136 participants in a leadership development program, I examined the relationship between individual differences in internal (i.e., need for cognitive closure [NFC]) and external factors (i.e., seniority, culture) and MTL in the autonomous work team environment. The data showed that high NFC individuals had high noncalculative and social-normative MTL and, thus, were more likely to become leaders in their work teams. There was also a significant interaction between culture and gender in regard to socialnormative MTL. Seniority was not an influential predictor for social-normative MTL. © Society for Personality Research.},

All participants were presented with a lottery scenario that required them to choose between a lottery ticket and a coupon that they could redeem when making a purchase or to set a price at which they would sell the same lottery ticket. Perceptual fluency was elicited by asking participants to read the scenario set out in a way that was either easy or difficult to understand. The results showed that when the likelihood of getting a desirable outcome was relatively high, participants who experienced decreased perceptual fluency tended to be risk aversive in the choice task but risk seeking in the pricing task. Accordingly, several mechanisms are discussed that potentially underlie this preference reversal effect along with theoretical and practical implications of our findings. © Society for Personality Research.},

Also assessed were respondents' attitudes about the responsibility of individuals and of society to help those in need, the individual's obligation to engage in social and political action, and the quality of social support available to participants. Collectivism was associated most strongly with personal responsibility and with a strong social support network, while individualism was related to a perceived responsibility to participate in social and political activism. Neither individualism nor collectivism was predictive of time spent volunteering. The findings suggest that rather than predicting who will, and will not, volunteer, the individualism/collectivism construct is useful in clarifying why people help.

Conscious and explicit adult attachment were assessed using 2 multiple self-report measures; namely, the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ; Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991) and the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale (ECR; Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998). The implicit processes of adult attachment were assessed using 2 IATs, which were developed based on the 2-dimensional attachment model (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991). Self-esteem, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), and subjective well-being, as measured by the Face Scale (Andrews & Withey, 1976), were designed as potential correlates of the implicit and explicit attachment measures. Fifty-six undergraduates participated in this study, and it was concluded that both the Self-IAT and the Other-IAT (1) could be used to measure adult attachment with satisfactory reliability and validity; (2) were significantly related to the 2 dimensions of adult attachment, as measured by the RQ and the ECR; (3) correlated significantly positively with subjective well-being, but not with explicit self-esteem.

Our purpose in this study was to construct performance indicators (PIs) for comprehensive high schools (CHSs), which provide general and occupational education programs. A literature review was completed, a panel discussion held, and field interviews were conducted. An analytical hierarchy process was used to make decisions on a framework of PIs for CHSs in Taiwan. The 2 main conclusions were that the most important indicator of performance in CHSs is the domain of "student and development" and that the difference between the experts' and practitioners' viewpoints on those schools' performances should be addressed in the near future. © Society for Personality Research.},

If maternal parenting is an environmental experience for adolescents' regulative temperamental trait, it should account for effortful control differences between siblings growing up in the same family even after the genetic effect on adolescents' effortful control is taken into account. This hypothesis was tested in 585 pairs of Chinese monozygotic (MZ) twins. Results revealed that within MZ pairs, the twin receiving more warm, nurturant-involved maternal parenting and less hostile, harsh-inconsistent maternal parenting had a higher level of effortful control. These results suggest that markedly different maternal parenting situations, such as a nonshared environment, have an effect on adolescents' effortful control.

Almost all did not find working in the street safe; and nearly half were not hopeful about the future. It was established that frequent problems in the children's families include poverty, unemployment, poor education, having a large family, poor family functioning, migration, limited possibilities of shelter, and domestic violence, including the beating of wives and children. Although nearly all the children still lived with their families, a small percentage of the children (5.8%) had begun living permanently on the streets and then cut ties with their families.

They lived on islands for a long time, were good at trading, and had a high material living standard, versatile language, and facial features similar to Western people. It is assumed from many reasonable interpretations of questions concerning their cultural characteristics that they may be descended from Dutch preachers and their families in Shaulon, Tainan, who married local Pingpu Aborigines. The Shau fled from Soulang when Zheng Chen-Kung (also known as Coxinja) attacked in 1661, moving to Mattauw, then to Dorcko, Tilaossen, and finally to Lehyee, the territory of Chou Aborigines, where they settled at Laichi for a time.

Findings that emerge from the results are: Firstly, when online reviews are high quality this has a positive effect on the purchasing intention of online shoppers. Secondly, when there are a high number of online reviews this positively affects the purchasing intention of online shoppers. Finally, shoppers with a high need for cognition take the central route in attitude change, but shoppers with a low need for cognition tend to adopt the peripheral route in forming attitude.

It was argued in this study that one reason for these inconsistent results may be an existing moderating effect. Stress does not always result directly from the source of pressure itself, but rather from the perception of that pressure. Therefore, individual difference variables (e.g., emotional intelligence) that might relate to that perception should also be considered. The effects of emotional intelligence on the relationship between job stress and job performance were investigated with a sample of employees in the Taiwanese finance sector. The results indicated that emotional intelligence had a positive impact on job performance and moderated this relationship. In this respect, highly emotionally intelligent employees are more likely than are low emotional intelligence employees to be able to reduce or transform the potential negative effects of job stress on job performance. The results of this study clarify knowledge of stress effects and, thus, the usefulness of stress management practices can be improved and enhanced. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Half a year after the earthquake, 196 preearthquake and 116 postearthquake orphans who survived were recruited. All participants completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire for Children (Gong, 1984) and Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale (Smith, Perrin, Dyregrov, & Yule, 2003). The regression analysis showed that the Neuroticism score was the strongest predictor of the severity of PTSD symptoms for both pre- and postearthquake orphans. For the preearthquake orphans, the Extraversion trait predicted Arousal negatively, and the Lie trait predicted Intrusion and Arousal positively. However, for the postearthquake orphans, only the Extraversion trait predicted Avoidance positively. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

These foci occur in part because social phobics tend to be introverted and obsessivecompulsives either perceive themselves as having onerous responsibilities or actually do have them (e.g., women with infants). These assumptions have empirical support (Eysenck). We can use the theory to predict cross-cultural differences in anxiety disorders. Social phobia should be more common in introverted cultures. We correlated lifetime incidence of social phobia (data: Wittchen & Fehm, 2001) with extraversion (data: Steel & Ones, 2002) across several countries, obtaining the predicted negative correlation (-0.35). We will expand the database to establish definitively the strength of this association. We will also explore the prediction that people in individualistic countries (emphasizing personal responsibility) have a higher incidence of obsessive-compulsive disorder than those in collectivistic countries, a prediction receiving preliminary support (e.g., Essau, Sakano, Ishikawa, & Sasagawa, 2004). © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

By conducting a 2 (attribution of responsibility: internal vs. external attribution) × 2 (time of the missed promotion: prepurchase vs. postpurchase promotion) experiment with 202 participants, we found that greater perceived price unfairness (PPU) is generated when consumers attribute missing the promotion to the sellers' actions. Additionally, PPU is more likely to induce anger than disappointment and regret. The time of the missed promotion alters the impact of PPU on regret. Lastly, consumers who experience high levels of anger and disappointment tend to complain and spread negative word of mouth while those who experience high regret tend to be inactive. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

  abstract = {In this article the basic principles of belief-importance (belimp) theory are described, according to which it is hypothesized that personality traits confer a propensity to perceive convergences and divergences between an individual's belief that he/she can attain certain goals and the importance that he/she places on these goals. Belief and importance are conceptualized as 2 coordinates, together defining the belimp plane. Within the belimp plane 4 distinct quadrants can be identified (hubris, motivation, depression, and apathy) and in the present study (N = 532) the hypothesis is tested that these broadly correspond to the personality dimensions of trait emotional intelligence, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and introversion. Twelve specific hypotheses were advanced, of which 10 were fully borne out by the data and 2 partially. The results are interpreted with emphasis on the theoretical and practical advantages of belimp theory. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Based upon the perspective of "affect-as-information" and the mood repair hypothesis, we examined differences in individuals' perspective taking arising when they felt either guilt or shame. Undergraduates (N = 114) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 affect-inducing conditions. After receiving affect manipulation, they were asked to engage in a perspective-taking task and to make judgments about how other people thought. Compared with participants in a neutral mood, participants experiencing guilt showed better perspective taking, and participants experiencing shame showed worse perspective taking. In general, the results suggest that an individual's inclination to take other persons' perspectives into consideration has a differential effect on mood repair depending on whether behavior is motivated by shame or guilt. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The conclusion we reached is not that the original model of Kerr and Jermier is wrong, but rather that the methods used to test leadership interactions have not been appropriate.

The themes formed the kinesthetic-vestibular developmental model illustrating how sensorimotor exercises push the therapy process forward while recurrent regressions are followed by positive developmental phases.

In this study it is proposed that market competitiveness plays an important role in determining the influence of perceived managerial discretion on firm performance. In a survey of 169 top managers of Chinese enterprises, it was found that in highly competitive markets, perceived managerial discretion was positively related to firm performance. In contrast, where there is little competition, perceived managerial discretion and firm performance were negatively correlated. These results suggest that companies operating in highly competitive markets should permit managers greater discretion to make strategic choices to react to the dynamics of the environment. Conversely, companies in less competitive markets should limit managerial discretion to prevent managers abusing this power for personal benefits. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Nondyslexics out performed dyslexics significantly in visual-verbal memory of words for concrete objects and abstract concepts and in audio-verbal memory of words for abstract concepts. Dyslexic students performed significantly better in visual and audio memory of concrete words compared to abstract concepts; their visual-spatial memory was better than their visual-semantic memory, and their pictorial memory was also better than their verbal memory. Dyslexic students scored higher than nondyslexics for original thinking and equally as high in overall creativity.

Both members of 45 divorced couples also completed the KAI. Significantly more adaptor/adaptor dyads (32/45, i.e., 71%) were found among married couples than in the divorced sample, suggesting that the preference for structure characteristic of spouses in adaptor/adaptor pairings enables them to produce mutually beneficial approaches to change and solutions to problems in their marriages.

Two high-loading factors were extracted from both sexes and labeled "Fatigue and neuroticism versus extraversion", and "Psychoticism versus lie". A multiple stepwise regression was carried out and the predictors of ASCFS were found to be neuroticism and psychoticism (positive) and extraversion (negative) among men, while in women the predictors were neuroticism and psychoticism.

Fourteen participants were measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with the visual Go/No-go task after normal sleep and following 36 hours of TSD. The TSD-induced positive and negative blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals compared with that after a normal night's sleep (NORM). The areas activated with positive BOLD signals include the superior prefrontal cortex and inferior prefrontal cortex, with negative BOLD signals in the anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) and right lingual gyrus. Increased activation may be related to the compensatory response since more attention resources are needed to perform the Go/No-go task after 36 hours of TSD and the decreased activation in the ACC may reflect the impact of executive control function by the TSD. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Overall, we attained significant results which were consistent with the RBT predictions but we moved beyond previous RBT studies, offering new findings and insights. It was found that TL has a significant influence on both interaction behaviors and employee job satisfaction, interaction behaviors have a significant influence on satisfaction, and the interaction behaviors act as mediators to enhance the effect of TL on satisfaction. It is suggested that interaction behaviors should be incorporated with TL to increase employee satisfaction because interaction behaviors are highly dependent on TL to support the integration of information, resources, and technology in group goal attainment, which helps to increase satisfaction. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The attitudes and beliefs of a sample of South African students regarding homosexuality and same-sex marriage were investigated. A survey was conducted among a sample of 150 undergraduate students at a predominantly black university in the Western Cape. Results showed that 71% viewed samesex marriages as strange and supported religious groups opposed to such marriages. Close to 40% supported discrimination against homosexuals with 46% indicating that they should be denied the right to adopt children. It is concluded that, despite having legal protection, public acceptance of homosexuals and same-sex marriage may be quite limited in South Africa. © Society for Personality Research Inc.},

Our model identified the following antecedents as being potentially linked to workaholism: personality traits, personal inducements, and organizational inducements. Obsessive compulsion, achievement orientation, perfectionism, and conscientiousness are key personality traits leading to workaholism. Intrinsic work values and vicarious learning in the family are two components of personal inducements, while putting work ahead of family commitments, peer competition, and vicarious learning at the workplace constitute three organizational inducements.},

Four Chinese-version personality questionnaires, Myers-Briggs Type Indication Form G, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2, 16 Personality Factors and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, were used. The results showed that either a 4- or a 5-factor design appears to be the best choice for the Chinese version of the MBTI, the SN scale can be further divided into two parts, with one dealing with the problem "where to gather or perceive information", and the other involving attitudes towards, and methods for selecting, information.

Results showed that students in Taiwan exhibit higher perceived stress and experience lower actual social support, higher actual social support may result in lower perceived stress, and the students' social network was limited to segregation with international Chinese college students in Taiwan.

In addition, ANOVA revealed that male drivers and drivers with low self-concept report more dangerous driving than do females and drivers with high self-concept, correspondingly. Results give evidence in favor of a hypothesis that low self-concept is connected to dangerous driving. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The attrition rate for students entering baccalaureate nursing education programs is approximately 30%, with most (82.3%), leaving in their first semester of study (Morgan, 2001). Schools of nursing need to establish ways to decrease student attrition from programs. This study was an attempt to determine whether self-esteem, self-efficacy, and environmental variables are predictors of student attrition in first-semester baccalaureate nursing students, using a descriptive correlational design to explore the relationship between these variables in a non-probability convenience sample of 66 first semester baccalaureate nursing students.

First, highly skeptical consumers tend to base their attitudes on intrinsic beliefs instead of situational factors; that is, they are biased against certain types of information and indifferent to the message quality. Second, consumers with low skepticism tend to adopt the peripheral route in forming attitude; that is, they are more persuaded by review quantity. These findings contribute to the ELM research literature by considering a potentially important personality factor in the ELM framework.

Results supported construct validity of the Chinese version of the MBTI-G (Miao, Huangfu, Chia, & Ren, 2004), for there were four factors extracted based on the two samples respectively. However, factor analysis results raised questions about the nature of the Sensation-Intuition scale.

The analysis of the research results shows that the secure attachment style and the three PTSD trauma symptom clusters in DSM-IV - intrusion, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal - discriminate between the three subsamples. In other words, security workers who were directly and actively confronted with a critical incident were significantly more insecurely attached and suffered significantly more from PTSD symptoms than the groups who had no or indirect experience of a critical incident. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy is widely and quite efficiently used in the treatment of PTSD.

Results based on data collected from 433 mall intercept interviews in Taiwan indicate that there is a strong positive relationship between allocentrism toward parents and CET. However, a significantly negative relationship between allocentrism toward friends and CET was also found. It was also found that friends' in-group attitude toward Korean television dramas has a mediating effect of allocentrism toward friends on CET and CET on intention to buy Korean products. In this study, it was found that CET played a mediating role between allocentrism toward parents and friends and purchase intention. This ethnocentric effect was attributed to parental and friends' in-groups which significantly enhanced and reduced, respectively, the impact of intergroup discrimination, making national identification a less obvious and important social category. These findings have significant implications for domestic and foreign marketers. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

In 2006, this survey was replicated using identical methods of data collection and a sample which was representative of university enrolments for 2006 in terms of gender and race: N = 543, gender = 50% female; race = black (40%), Indian (40%), white (17%), colored (3%). Over the four-year period, there was a significant increase in mean item-scores for old-fashioned racism [M = 1.95 vs. 2.15; F(1,971) = 15.16, p < .01], and this finding was supported by a significant study x race interaction, F(3, 971) = 6.33, p < .05. Mean item scores increased significantly over time among Indians (2.11 vs. 2.29) but not among blacks (1.74 vs. 1.76), coloreds (2.01 vs. 2.04), or whites (2.33 vs. 2.35). A significant increase in levels of modern racism over the four-year period [M = 2.74 vs. 3.10; F(1,971) = 8.48, p < .01] was indicated by a significant study x race interaction, F(3, 971) = 7.31, p < .05, with mean item scores increasing significantly over time among Indians (2.94 vs. 3.62) and whites (3.00 vs. 3.58) but not among blacks (2.04 vs. 2.06) or coloreds (2.47 vs. 2.49).

As patients with schizotypal, antisocial, and borderline personality disorders show reduced amplitude and prolonged latency of classical P3, it is reasonable to expect that these patients might show an abnormal passive P3. We tested whether the single tone elicited event-related potentials (ERPs) in 205 patients with personality disorders and in 30 healthy volunteers. Their Axis I symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured by Zung's Self-rating Depression Scale and Self-rating Anxiety Scale (1965, 1971). Both schizoid and paranoid groups showed significantly reduced P3 amplitude. In addition, the schizoid group showed significantly shortened N1 latency and enhanced N2 amplitude. Most patient groups except schizoids scored higher on the Depression or Anxiety scales, or both, but the ERP findings were not correlated with the Axis I symptoms in any given group alone. The abnormal negative components implied a higher vigilance or cortical arousal level in the schizoid patients, while the reduced P3 amplitude indicated a poorer passive attention in both schizoid and paranoid patients.},

A maladapted personality with a background of emotional instability, as well as a tendency to inhibit these emotions in social interaction, constitutes a fertile field for poor health and, perhaps, for the appearance and development of disease.

The results suggested that patients differ in adult attachment styles and varied significantly in all indices of social support and depression. Secure subjects got higher scores in social support and lower scores of depression. Their depression level had significant positive correlations with attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety, and was negatively correlated to all indices of social support.

Here the compounding effects of a connection type (inclusion) and its "variant" (ordering) are investigated. A network position is "inclusively connected" when it must exchange with two or more others for benefits to come from any one. By contrast, ordering occurs when a series of exchanges must be completed in a given sequence. Resistance theory asserts that ordering is a variant (has similar but distinct effects) of inclusion and, when found together, the joint effect of the two is greater than when either is found separately. Predictions of the combined effects of the two structural power conditions of exchange are offered and investigated. Results suggest stronger effects than anticipated. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

As expected, with a source of misattribution, participants did not change their attitude, but trivialized.

Chinese students were more prone to risky options. Results of the Chinese sample showed that the type of framing effect was unidirectional, characterized by predominant risk seeking under both framing conditions, with more risk seeking under the negative frame than the positive frame. The framing effect was evaluated using the balanced format condition as an objective measure of the existing risk preference. Results suggest that the military participants were influenced by both positive format and negative format, and in the Chinese civil sample the negative format had an important effect. These findings expand the literature on risk decision by demonstrating the framing effect and comparing results from Chinese and American participants.},

They do so possibly in order to acquire more information, or even to "wait" in the hope that new information may be forthcoming before they make a decision. However, recent studies have provided scant information about how waiting affects a person's choice given different emotional states. In this paper, an experimental study was carried out to demonstrate and explain the relationship between waiting and a person's choice. Results show that when conditions are certain, more people choose to wait - when they are in a positive emotional state - in order to maintain their current mood. However, under either certain or uncertain conditions, when people are in a negative emotional state they prefer to take immediate action rather than wait. The causes and implications of this phenomenon are discussed in relation to the existing literature on emotions and choice.},

As expected (1) older individuals with more rigidity held significantly more negative aging stereotypes over time, (2) older individuals with more negative aging stereotypes had significantly more negative aging self-perceptions over time, and (3) negative aging stereotypes partially mediated the relationship between rigidity and negative aging self-perceptions.

Results suggested that, in spite of some inherent uniqueness, L2 learning is similar to other subjects in the school environment and the MSLQ has the potential to be applied to L2-related studies.},

Bolitho, Carr, and Fletcher (2007) have since added a fifth factor: "Blame conflict". In the Spanish-speaking samples, a factorial structure composed of five factors can be observed.

Ninety participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions: failure, success, or control. Our regression analyses based on both original and bootstrap samples indicate that perceived inclusion does not mediate the effect of feedback on state self-esteem for individuals high in task-related identified regulation. Such an effect only operates for individuals low in task-related identified regulation. In sum, our results show that the perceived inclusion process proposed by sociometer theory applies more when individuals find that the activity is less important for them (i.e., identified regulation). © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

For this purpose, a self-report instrument was employed that measures different kinds of aggressive behaviors in situations in which it may be considered justified: the Cuestionario de Actitudes Morales sobre Agresión (CAMA; Ramirez, 1991), a reliable and valid test to measure the different degrees to which youth and adolescents may justify interpersonal aggression (Ramirez & Andreu, 2006). A large sample (N = 735) of participants from various educational centers of Madrid was utilized. Results revealed that normative beliefs vary as a function of age, sex, and the instrumental-reactive context. Reactive situations elicited higher levels of justification than instrumental situations and higher levels in the justifying beliefs about severe aggression were found among men than among women and in adolescents than in young adults. There were no significant differences in the justifying beliefs about moderate aggression. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

In this study, organizational socialization was examined as a factor to explain and more completely understand burnout. Results from a sample of 397 employees in people-oriented professions and organizations in Taiwan revealed that organizational socialization was significantly related to all three components of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. The strength of the prediction was particularly apparent on the dimension of reduced personal accomplishment.

In the second study, psychological vulnerability was associated with higher ambivalence. Individuals with high levels of extraversion were more likely to seek social support if parenthood decisions became too difficult, and persons with higher levels of openness to experience were more likely to make decisions based on their feelings. Associations of neuroticism with avoidant coping were mediated by level of ambivalence. The conclusion drawn is that sex education with adolescents should include information about ambivalence and promote adequate ways of coping with this phenomenon. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Emotional responses were significantly stronger in the friend, senior, and junior conditions than in the acquaintance condition for both positive and negative episodes, suggesting the degree of intimacy in the interpersonal relationship influenced emotional contagion. Emotional responses were also stronger in the junior condition than in the senior condition, suggesting that social power in interpersonal relationships influenced emotional contagion. Moreover, sad expressions resulting from partners' disclosures did not differ across conditions, reflecting the display rule of negative emotions in Japan.

The children with nonculturally approved sexual activity with adults and those from the mental health service displayed verbal intelligence scores that were about one SD below the scores for children referred by the school board and for the control group. These results suggest that psychological variables may not reflect a causal relationship and hence group differences should not be attributed exclusively to the diagnosis of sexual abuse.},

Fifty-four instrumental music students participated in this study. Research data were collected using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck, Epstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988) and the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale (Weissman & Beck, 1978). The results revealed that there are significant positive correlations between anxiety and total score of dysfunctional attitudes, and the need for approval (p < .05). The ANOVA results also showed that while there was no main effect of perfectionism, need for approval and gender had significant effects (p < .05) on anxiety. However, interaction effects of perfectionism, need for approval, and gender on anxiety were not significant.

We investigated the relationship between spiritual experiences (SE) and mental distress within two sociodemographically balanced samples (n = 100) of spiritually practicing (SP) and a nonpracticing sample (NSP) for two points of measurement (r1; r2). Applying linear regression analysis we compared the influence from SEs, as measured with the Exceptional Experiences Questionnaire (EEQ; Kohls & Walach, 2006), towards mental distress measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Klaiberg, 2002). A strong association between the EEQ (t1) and the BSI (t1, t2) for the NSP (NSP: R2t1 = .36; R2t2 = .27) was found, but only a weak, relatively moderate one for the SP sample (SP: R2t1 = .07; R 2t2 = .16). Path analysis revealed that SP seems to buffer deconstructive spiritual experiences (SP: βt1 = .06 (ns); βα = .18 (ns); NSP: βt1 = .52 (p < .01); βt2 = .39 (p < .01)) but not Psychopathological experiences (SP: βt1 = .20 (p = ns); βt2 = .33 (p < .01); NSP: βt1 = .18 (p = ns); βt2 = .31 (p < .01), although no significant relationship was found for positive spiritual experiences and visionary dream experiences for either sample. Our findings suggest that spiritual practice seems to be a potential buffer for distress derived from experiences of ego loss. Correspondingly, the differentiation between experiences of ego loss and psychopathological experiences seems to be pivotal for understanding the intrapersonal effects of SP. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Results showed that the factor structure of the Turkish version of the SELSA-S was largely similar to the original one. Finally, each subscale demonstrated high internal consistency, and as predicted was correlated with theoretically related loneliness measures and other relevant constructs, along with displaying temporal stability. Test-retest reliability coefficients for the social, family and romantic subscales were .88, .83 and .91, respectively.

Finally, the evaluation and emotion-based satisfaction would enhance online buyers' repurchase intention when they are characterized as having higher risk preference. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Data were collected using a cross-sectional design, via anonymous, self-reporting questionnaires. Delinquent adolescents were found to have a higher incidence of dysfunctional family dynamics, greater incidence of antisocial personality, higher tendency to depression, and higher levels of aggressive impulsiveness than nondelinquent adolescents. Delinquent adolescents reported higher incidences of being sexually abused, and alcohol and drug abuse, and showed a greater tendency toward cognitive and behavioral avoidance coping strategies compared to nondelinquent adolescents. Person-related aggressive impulsiveness, antisocial personality tendency, and self-injurious aggressive impulsiveness had the largest significant total effects on aggressive behavior among Korean adolescents. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Subjects engaged in a two-stage decision process. In the first stage, a decision was made concerning the size of the group formed (if any) and its homogeneity or diversity in membership. Larger groups were chosen when 8 versus 4 items were gathered and when the items were geographically dispersed. Groups tended to be more diverse when items were dispersed rather than locally concentrated and when time was short (20 minutes). Payoff division was a second-stage decision.

The LLS had significant and positive correlations with the Oxford Happiness Inventory (Argyle, Martin, & Lu, 1995), optimism, self-esteem, hope, satisfaction with life, and extraversion. Therefore, the LLS received strong concurrent validational support in terms of these correlations. A factor analysis of the total scores on the LLS and the six other questionnaires yielded a general factor of well-being onto which the LLS loaded .78.

To achieve this, the Chinese version of the BDI-II (C-BDI-II) was administered to a clinical sample of outpatients suffering depression, and also to a nonclinical sample. Detailed FPCS procedures were illustrated and the raw score and FPCS were compared in terms of reliability and validity. The Cronbach alpha coefficient showed that the reliability of C-BDI-II was higher in FPCS than in raw score. Moreover, the analytical results showed that, via FPCS, the probability of correct classification of clinical and nonclinical was increased from 73.2% to 80.3%. That is, BDI scoring via FPCS achieves more accurate depression predictions than does raw score. Via FPCS, erroneous judgments regarding depression can be eliminated and medical costs associated with depression can be reduced. This study empirically showed that FST can be applied to psychological research as well as engineering. FST characterizes latent traits or human thinking more accurately than does crisp binary logic. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

There were 42 participants; a target group of 21 adolescents who had a defined behavioral problem, and a matched referential group of 21 adolescents who did not. The results suggest that attributes related to primary psychopathy are rooted in low anxiety/low fear, and predict both instrumental and emotional aggression. Moreover, attributes related to secondary psychopathy seem rooted in temperamental approach and are positively associated with dysregulation of negative affect. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

ET (Empathic tendency) and ES (Empathic skill) scales were used to collect data. The first stage of the study was descriptive and longitudinal (n = 20). There were significant differences in ET average between the years. There were also significant differences in ES average between the first and second, and third and fourth year students. The second stage of the study was descriptive and cross-sectional (n = 192). There were no significant differences in ET means between the years of the program, but there were significant differences in ES points between the years of the program. It can be concluded that nursing students exposed to PBL develop empathic skills through the years of the PBL program. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Bidders may be influenced by other bidders in order to reduce perceived risk or collect better product information. Based on the influence of online customer reviews, and Lascu and Zinkhan's conformity model (1999), this research is designed to build on the exploratory research with three important factors that affect conformity bidder behaviors: informational social influence (mediator), perceived risk, and product involvement. The experiment involved 480 students from a university in northern Taiwan who have used online auction services within the last six months. Data were completed within a 2-week period in the summer of 2006 for two products: mobile phone (high involvement) and t-shirt (low involvement). The two variables, total number of bids and ratings of sellers, were manipulated. Each subject was randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions. The hypothesis (perceived risks will significantly influence online bidders' conformity) was supported in experiments. The results show that bidders are more susceptible to interpersonal influence, when one is more highly involved with a product. It was also proved that perceived risk would affect bidders' conformity, suggesting that marketers can take specific actions such as positive word of mouth to create a positive impression. The findings of this study take us far beyond the existing literature. Exploration can be conducted in the future for other products or different nationalities to better understand bidders' conformity behavior. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The study assessed how the behavior of Japanese and United States tourists has been affected. The results indicate clear differences in rebound status between Japanese and American visitor arrivals that are remarkably consistent with Hofstede's conceptualization - the Japanese tended toward uncertainty avoidance more than the Americans. However, individual tourists and different cultures react differently toward different episodes, which is an important area for academic research and managerial practice. Thus, this study empirically examines the relationship between personality traits and travel behaviors in response to adverse events, adopting a cross-cultural perspective. The Big Five model is used to measure the respondents' personality attributes when purchasing travel products. This model is widely applied in different fields. It accounts for most of the variance in the field of personality: Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience (Digman, 1990).

An empirical survey was conducted, and statistical analysis was utilized to analyze the 404 responses. The empirical evidence confirms the theory of Vallerand et al. that the passion for online computer games can be divided into two subdimensions, namely harmonious passion and obsessive passion. Furthermore, the influences of harmonious and obsessive passion on players' addiction to online computer games differ significantly. Obsessive passion may lead to addiction, while harmonious passion normally does not. These results support the argument that only obsessive passion leads to negative outcomes. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

As the statistical analyses, GEE method, stepwise regression analysis and missing value analyses were used. The items that had the greatest negative effect on the students' success were "has poor school work" and "can't concentrate or can't pay attention for long". On the other hand, the item that had the greatest positive effect on students' success was "feels he/she has to be perfect".

For example, Okada (2005) found people prefer hedonic alternatives when choices are presented singly, but choose utilitarian options in joint presentations. She theorized that this preference reversal is due to guilt over hedonic purchases. This study was designed to investigate choices in a sales promotion context. Forty-two university student volunteers were divided into five groups. Four of the groups read a description of one of four $15 promotional offers (plain t-shirt, school t-shirt, designer t-shirt, $15 in cash) and the fifth saw all four offers; respondents were asked whether the offer(s) would prompt them to travel to a store 20 miles away to purchase a $100 pair of jeans. They were also asked to rate the item(s) on a hedonic scale and a utilitarian scale. A comparison of promotions presented singly with promotions presented jointly did not support Okada's theory of preference reversal. In this study, the plain t-shirt (high utility/low hedonism) elicited more positive responses when presented alone, χ2(1, N= 18) = 6.77, p < .01; the designer t-shirt (low utility/high hedonism) drew more positive responses when presented in a set, χ2(l, N =17) = 5.03, p < .05, suggesting a contrast effect rather than a guilt effect. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Older individuals think about the future less than younger individuals even though age is not correlated with worrying about or imagining the future. Christians think more about the future than others although they also tend to worry less about the future. Secularists are less able to imagine the future.

The main hypothesis was that by modifying a school's social climate, one can either help or disable the development of students' constructive coping strategies and thus support, or not, students' academic success. Our most important conclusion is that the school climate parameters, especially the school value system and teachers' attitudes toward students as perceived by the latter, influence students' optimistic acceptance of life, their psychological and physiological well-being, and academic success. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Thirty-one Japanese participants viewed 8 films selected to elicit specific emotions (amusement, anger, contentment, disgust, fear, neutral, sadness, and surprise) and evaluated their emotional experiences using 16 discrete and 2 dimensional emotion scales. The discrete scales indicated that all of the films evidently elicited the target emotions, as well as some nontarget emotions.

There were 315 participants in the study. A Turkish adaptation of the Negative Acts Questionnaire Scale (NAQ) developed by Einarsen and Raknes (1997) was used. Cronbach's alpha = .97, factor loads were determined to be between .42 and .82. Frequency, percentage, arithmetic mean, chi-square and variance analysis were also measured. The results were tested at p < .05 level. The research showed that 50% of the Turkish primary school teachers had experienced bullying. There was a significant relationship between the incidence of bullying and the branch of teaching. However, there was no relationship between bullying experiences and the variables of sex, age and marital status. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Use of this model overcomes some of the apparent contradictions between the different models of volunteerism. For example, for the Functional Model, motivations, and more specifically their satisfaction, would be the best predictors of service duration, however, for the Role Identity Model, what best predicts service duration would be role identity. We assume that in the initial phase of volunteerism, motivations and their satisfaction are more closely related to service duration than role identity. Nevertheless, to predict longer duration of service and greater involvement, the fundamental variable is organizational commitment. Finally, the Role Identity Model is that which best explains sustained volunteerism. Instruments used included the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (Mowday, Steers, & Porter, 1979) reduced and adapted by Dávila & Chacón, and The Role Identity Scale (Grube & Pilavin, 2000, adapted by Dávila & Chacón, 2004). © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The Albert Einstein College of Medicine Coping Styles Questionnaire (AECOM-CSQ; Plutchik & Conte, 1989), and the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scales (Hamilton, 1959, 1960) were used for the assessment. Post hoc analysis of variance for comparisons between groups and logistic regressions using coping styles as predictor variables for group classification were used for data analysis. The main findings were that alcohol-dependent individuals could be distinguished from either depressed or control subjects on the ground of their coping mechanisms with stress, and that men and women use different patterns of psychological adaptation. More specifically, group classification in terms of specific coping styles could be predicted with an overall accuracy of more than 84%; in men, classification related to the coping mechanism of substitution, and in women to blame, reversal, and substitution.

In many studies (Kouabenan, 1998; Slovic, 1987; Slovic et al., 1981), risk perception appears to be an important factor in understanding attitudes towards accident prevention and self-protective behavior. A questionnaire measuring several dimensions of perceived MRSA risk (risk for oneself, risk for others, severity, controllability, frequency, preventive efforts) and a questionnaire assessing optimism were administered to 187 hospital staff members of various occupations. The results revealed that the risk of MRSA contamination was well perceived as a whole by healthcare personnel. However, certain factors like proximity to patients and length of service tended to be accompanied by an underestimation of the risk, while other factors like little education, working part-time, and a lack of experience tended to cause overestimation. Preventive measures are recommended. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The main theoretical framework adopted is object relations theories which have been particularly renowned for drawing close attention to the process and development of the early dyadic mother-infant relationship as a primary departure point for understanding both healthy and pathological psychic development. These theories have been especially comprehensive in depicting the inner world of the infant as magical and terrifying, fractured and kaleidoscopic. Within the context of narcissistic dynamics, one aspect of human behavior may be described as non-pathological and the basis for healthy ambitions and ideals, while another may be identified as pathological and destructive so that individuals behave in grandiose and murderous ways. Some of these individuals are sadistic serial killers who enjoy the sexual thrill of murdering and who are both pathological and destructive narcissists. This study examines the psychological roots of the behavior of sexually motivated male serial killers, and why they do what they do. The context of serial murder is presented, with a refined definition of sexually motivated serial murder. The development of narcissism is described as this forms the basis for understanding such behavior. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

  abstract = {In recent years there has been much contested debate around the psychology of prejudice and the extent to which it is essentially an outcome of a variety of personality-related variables or whether the social context with which one identifies plays an equally, if not more, important role. Debate has also focused on the complex interplay of personality and social context. This study, using a combination of survey and experimental methodology, examined the extent to which antigay prejudice among men is predicted by right-wing authoritarianism, social-dominance orientation, and identity as a heterosexual. In phase 1 (n = 112) antigay stereotypes were found to be significantly related to right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation, but nevertheless best predicted by right-wing authoritarianism (β = .27, p < .01) and in phase 2 (n = 52), despite males' sexual identity being primed, heterosexual identity was still not significantly related to measures of prejudice. These results are discussed with reference to the nature of authoritarianism and social-dominance orientation, as well as social-identity theory. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The participants' demographic information, perceived similarity to the target, and experience with someone similar to the target were also examined. Results demonstrated that the targets with anorexia and bulimia were viewed significantly more negatively than were excessive exercising and control targets. Perceived personal similarity to the target also significantly increased positive ratings of the targets, which suggests that those who have had an eating disorder may empathize with those who are currently struggling. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

They also pursue intellectual stimulation, avoid exposure to harmful chemicals and drugs, and engage in behaviors that promote the health and welfare of their broader social community.

The attitudes of nurses towards suicide were more traditional than the attitudes of doctors. Nurses believed to a greater extent than doctors that suicidal people would be punished after death and that suicide in one's family was to be hidden.

The first hypothesis explored the linear causal relationship between parental attachment, peer attachment, and feelings of emotional loneliness. The second hypothesis tested the direct relationship between parental attachment and feelings of emotional loneliness, and the third hypothesis examined the reciprocity between feelings of emotional loneliness and peer attachment. Using Structural Equation Modeling, results showed that peer attachment mediates strongly between parental attachment and feelings of emotional loneliness. The direct contribution of parental attachment to feelings of emotional loneliness was rather weak. Finally, feelings of emotional loneliness did not contribute significantly to the explanation of peer-attachment style. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The results supported Fender's Health Promotion Model in which self-efficacy accounted for 58% of variance in health promotion behaviors. Health promotion behaviors were found to be correlated with level of education. Additionally, there were associations between self-efficacy and gender, marital status, and level of education.

No significant difference was found in the level of depression between the two groups. The overall level of depression found with both combined groups, was 2-3 times higher than those suggested in the literature. A positive correlation was found between the "Seeking Social Support" coping strategy and higher levels of depression among mothers of preterm infants. A positive correlation was also found among mothers of full-term infants who used the "Accepting Responsibility" coping strategy and higher levels of depression. The high number of mothers in this study identified as suffering from a depressive illness of varying severity raises concern. A clear need for professional help among this population is emphasized.

Lebanese students were more structuralistic, and had more external than internal locus of control than South Africans. The independent variable of class did not appear as a predictor to the structural attribution for poverty. Hence, university education may be the most important factor in the attributions of poverty.

This study was repeated for a second, select sample, 210 Dutch university students. In the latter study both moral reasoning and political attitudes were related to the evaluation of the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Moral reasoning was measured using the N2 index of the Defining Issues Test (Rest, 1979a). Political attitudes were measured using 10 Likert-type multiitem scales, representing both the cultural and the economic dimension of general political ideology. Participants' general moral thought was identified through their evaluation of the 30 articles of the UDHR. The intraindividual consistency of the evaluation of the 30 UDHR articles was used as a measure of the structure of moral thought. Factor analyses revealed that moral reasoning represented something different from political ideology. Regression analyses demonstrated that only a minor part of the variance in moral reasoning scores could be predicted by the combined effect of political attitudes. Moral reasoning scores were not related to the consistency of the evaluation of the 30 UDHR articles. Using SEM analyses, several models were tested describing the relations of moral reasoning, political ideology and consistency with the evaluation of human rights. It appeared that these variables all uniquely contributed to the explanation of moral thought. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

In addition to construct validity, Guttman split-half reliability and criterion validity of these three higher order factors revealed good reliability and validity outcomes. It was also emphasized that these 3 higher order factors constituted independent dimensions of coping styles. Implications of the results are discussed. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The finding of a strong link between sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV suggests that individuals with STIs may be at greatest risk for HIV infection. This study sought to gain insight regarding STI clinic attenders' perceptions of HIV/AIDS and alcohol as a risk factor with regard to HIV infection. Twenty-one men and women who were self-referrals at an STI dedicated clinic in Cape Town, South Africa, participated in the study. The findings showed that HIV/AIDS was cognitively represented as an STI, transmitted through risky sexual behavior such as casual sex, multiple sexual partners, and inconsistent condom use. Alcohol was implicated as a major risk factor to HIV infection because it was perceived as the main tool for transactional sex, lowering of sexual inhibitions and inconsistent use of condoms. The implications of these findings for the development of effective HIV/AIDS prevention programs are discussed. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Participants were administered a computerized task called the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998) aimed at assessing the strength of the association among concepts. As expected, results demonstrated that the category "fat person" was indeed more easily paired with low-contact jobs than with jobs requiring extensive interpersonal contact. In addition, media exposure and personal body weight were found to moderate the effect. In short, the study showed that fat persons are selectively associated in the mind with different job positions, and indications about potential moderating factors are provided. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Construct validity was evaluated by expert judges and, overall, was high. Validation data also included correlation with peer ratings. Furthermore, to explore the relation between moral imagination and actual behavior, a case study was conducted in which participants were asked questions to measure their capacity for moral imagination. The subjects who scored high on MI were judged to have a greater capacity than were the subjects who scored low.

It emerges that, at any point in time, the norms are remarkably stable across cultures, but have changed dramatically over time.

Of the various factors believed to be associated with sexual desire, gender (biological sex) is presumed by many theorists to be one of the most important. Limited empirical work suggests that men experience desire more frequently than do women; however, sex differences in intensity or level of desire have yet to be examined. This study explored both the self-reported frequency and intensity of sexual desire among an ethnically diverse sample of 676 men and women. As hypothesized, men reported experiencing a higher overall level of sexual desire than did women. Sex differences also were found with respect to frequency of sexual desire. Men reported experiencing sexual desire more often than did women and, when asked to estimate the actual frequency with which they experienced desire, men's estimated frequency (37 times per week) was significantly higher than women's (9 times per week). These results do not imply that men always feel desire or that women lack sexual desire. In fact, virtually every participant in this study reported feeling sexual desire on a regular basis. This suggests that desire may be the most universal sexual response experienced by both men and women. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Responses from 286 college undergraduates to the BEM Sex Role Inventory (Bern, 1974) and measures of well-being (i.e., loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale, revised by Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980), personal discomfort (Personal Discomfort Subscale of the Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Social Introversion-Extroversion Scale, Graham, Schroeder, & Lilly, 1971), self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Rosenberg, 1965), and social anxiety and avoidance (Social Anxiety and Social Avoidance Scale, Franke & Hymel, 1984) indicated both categorical and continuous measures of sex role were associated with well-being. Examination of sex-role categories revealed participants with masculine and androgynous orientations reported higher well-being scores than did those with feminine and undifferentiated orientations. Further, examination of separate femininity and masculinity scores indicated that masculinity was positively - and femininity was negatively - associated with participant reports of well-being.

Nursing students (N =105) participated in the study by completing questionnaires. Path analysis showed that the interrelation of locus of control, communication skills and perceived peer support and their relation with assertiveness are explained to a certain degree by the proposed model. The only variable that directly influenced assertiveness was communication skills. Perceived family support had no direct or indirect effect on assertiveness. The findings point to several considerations for nursing curricula including that faculties should plan and provide opportunities for learning activities that increase students' assertiveness. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Catholics had the highest level of alcohol drinking during adolescence. The lowest use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs was among Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormons). Family church attendance and religiosity among parents during the participants' adolescent years were both significantly protective against substance use in LDS but not among those of other religions or in those with no religious preference. LDS were most likely to agree that they chose to abstain or quit using tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs during their adolescent years because such behavior was inconsistent with their religious beliefs. LDS were also more likely to agree that current substance use was inconsistent with their religion, thus family weekly church attendance and parental religiosity during the participants' adolescent years were associated with lower substance use among LDS. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Results indicate that the majority of the students show a high degree of religious belief and religious involvement. Some religious variables - such as being a born-again Christian and considering religion as important - were associated with decreased Perceived Stress. Minor psychiatric morbidity as measured with the Self-reporting Questionnaire (SRQ; WHO, 1994) was positively associated with some religious beliefs and involvement, while meaning and direction in life was inversely associated with the SRQ score. All three religious coping styles were inversely associated with perceived stress. Contrary to expectations it was found that some of the religious coping styles were positively associated with minor psychiatric morbidity, especially the depression scores of the SRQ. Findings show that some religious variables were positively associated with mental health while others were inversely or not related, thus only partially supporting the religion-mental health link. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship between job characteristics and OCB and to clarify the mediating effects of job satisfaction. Two hundred and seventy employees from 24 electronic companies participated in this study. The results show that job variety and job significance had a significant positive relationship with OCB, whereas job identity, job autonomy, job feedback and job interdependence were not significantly related to OCB. Furthermore, job satisfaction, especially intrinsic satisfaction, was a mediating mechanism of the relationship between job variety, job significance and OCB. Finally, extrinsic satisfaction did not mediate the relationship between job characteristics and OCB. This finding suggests that practicing managers should enrich job characteristics and place greater emphasis on enhancing employees' intrinsic satisfaction to promote employees' OCB. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

All patient groups scored significantly higher than healthy controls on Submissiveness, Cognitive Distortion, Identity Problems, Intimacy Problems, Social Avoidance, and Self-Harm. In addition, the migraine group scored higher on Submissiveness than did the FETH group. Our findings thus confirmed personality dysfunctions in primary headache sufferers. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The authors assumed that in this developmental period, normally beset with questions about self-identity and interpersonal relatedness, the associations among Self-criticism, the Neediness component of dependency, and depressive symptomatology are moderated by participants' perceived social support as well as by their fear of death. As expected, the correlational results confirmed that depression in late adulthood is associated with Self-criticism, Neediness, fear of death, and low perceived social support. Additional results illustrated the protective role of Efficacy and Connectedness, as well as the buffering roles of social support and low fear of death in the relation between vulnerabilities to depression and depressive symptoms in late adulthood.

Findings were discussed in terms of helping doctors to alter their explanatory styles and possibly attenuate the influence of stressful events on their psychological distress. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

  abstract = {A community disaster training program focusing on earthquakes, floods and landslides was implemented in Çankin, Turkey, in 2002. It covered mitigation, preparedness and response aspects of natural disaster management. Four thousand community members participated in the training program delivered by 95 local trainers. This study evaluated the impact of participation in this program. One year later, 400 randomly selected participants in the training program and a comparable sample of 400 community members who did not participate in any disaster training program (nonparticipants) were surveyed. Disaster-related cognitions (i.e., disaster expectation, worry about future disasters, loss estimations if a disaster occurs, beliefs in the possibility of mitigation and preparedness) and reported preparedness behaviors were assessed. The relationship of sociodemographic, previous disaster experience, anxiety and locus of control variables with disaster-related cognitions and behaviors was examined. Results showed that participants in the training program had more disaster expectation, worry and loss estimation and more preparedness behaviors. Results of regression analyses, examining the relationship of the variables of the study with disaster cognitions, affect and actual preparedness behaviors showed that gender, education, being a participant in the training program, anxiety and locus of control are important variables related to different kinds of disaster-related cognitions. However, reported preparedness behaviors were quite low and this result needs to be viewed with caution. These results have important implications for the modification of programs for targeting sustainable behavioral change, which is likely to reduce the impact of future disasters. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The same is true for a larger grouping identified as the realistically content who appear satisfied with life and marriage. The largest grouping (Pollyannas) also appears highly satisfied with life and marriage. Of note, these participants also engage in selective recall negating the occurrence of negative events and perceptions of their spouse and marriage. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) suggests that Pollyannas convey a tendency for self-deception that distinguishes them from the other two groupings.

It plays a central role in the development of prosocial behavior and moral reasoning. However, the links between empathy and the major factors of personality have not yet been well described. This study explores the relationships between an index of empathy and the Big-Five personality model in a sample of 832 Spanish adolescents. As expected, results show that empathy correlates strongly with Friendliness. Positive correlations with Conscientiousness, Energy, and Openness traits have also been observed, but regression analyses show that relationships of empathy with those three factors were of negligible importance. Contrary to expectations, empathy did not correlate with Emotional stability. This pattern of results was replicated across boys and girls.},

Pre- and posttests were conducted using the Counseling Self-Estimate Inventory (COSE: Larson et al., 1992) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI: Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970). Significant mean differences were found between the experimental group and the control group in both counseling self-efficacy and anxiety. Analysis of covariance revealed that training increased trainees' counseling self-efficacy and decreased their level of anxiety.

Results indicate that approximately 18.4 percent of this rural population has had a diagnosable mental illness. Moreover, there is substantial overlap between physical health problems and psychological disorder for those with a psychological disorder (32.5%).

Eight hundred and forty-six employees from 41 organizations participated in the study. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) supported a direct relationship between need for achievement and job performance. However, no relationship was found between need for control and job performance. Moreover, when both personality variables were controlled for, the effect of prosocial behavior and commitment on job performance disappeared. This finding suggests that further work on the mediating effects of prosocial behavior and commitment on job performance is needed. Additional suggestions are given about the relationships among, and implications of, prosocial behavior, job performance, attitudinal, and personality variables.},

A questionnaire was used to determine demographic variables, family environmental factors (Moos & Moss, 1989), and suicidal behaviors. Logistic regression analysis showed that: conflict in a family was a significant correlate for three forms of suicidal behaviors studied; family independence, family cohesion, and family organization were also indicated as significant correlates for suicidal threats, however, family independence and organization correlate negatively with suicidal threat. Mental health workers and educators should consider these findings when planning preventive and therapeutic strategies for the minimization of suicidal behaviors among adolescents in the province.},

Investigation of the relationship between risk perceptions and stress response showed that high risk perceptions for transportation technologies were associated with elevated emotional and psychological stress, and poorer concentration in evacuees compared to controls. Results suggest that monitoring risk perceptions related to the cause of a technological accident is useful in predicting variance in evacuee response during a disaster.},

Using logistic regression, it was found that factors associated with living alone included gender, marital status, occupation, source of income, religion, and IADL. Living alone was, in turn, related to decreased levels of both perceived social support and feeling lonely after adjustment for potential confounders. Managing retired life is important for adult elders, particularly for men. Lack of social support is common among the elderly community who live alone, which could well be a main reason for this group to feel lonely. As loneliness is linked to physical and mental health problems, increasing social support and facilitating friendship should be factored into life-style management for communities of elderly.},

Most had experienced each event by the end of high school, with first dates and kisses occurring at earlier ages than falling in love or intercourse. Gender and ethnic differences were found. For example, young men began dating at earlier ages than did young women. Asian American participants were less sexually and romantically experienced, and had their very first sexual experiences at an older age, than African American, Latino/Hispanic, and Caucasian/non-Hispanic White participants. Interestingly, there were no differences in first romantic love experience. Almost all men and women within each ethnic group had fallen in love at least once, typically around age 17; this suggests that romantic love is a common human life event and that it first occurs during the developmental period spanning late adolescence and early adulthood.},

Analysis of these three components indicates that they align with a neoclassical model of the human psyche. A neoclassical psyche consists of at least three fundamental, irreducible capacities: cognition, affect, and conation. Sternberg's commitment component relies on the capacity for cognition (and conation), the passion component is derived from conation (and affect), and the intimacy component is derived from emotional investment or the capacity for affect (and cognition).

In addition, results of the second study suggest that attribution of ethnic outgroups' disadvantages to internal causes mediates the effect of belief in astrology on ethnic prejudice. Implications of these results are discussed.},

It was found that Mature defenses were associated only with Efficacy. Extensive use of Immature and Emotion-avoiding defenses was associated with vulnerability to depression. Furthermore, Immature defenses interacted with personality vulnerabilities. Specifically, highly self-critical participants who reported low levels of Immature defense were less depressed than were participants high on both Self-criticism and Immature defense. High Immature defense scores mediated the effect of Dependency on depression. Finally, more severe vulnerability was found when targets both rated themselves and were rated by their best friends as higher on Dependency and/or on Emotion-avoiding defenses. The implications of these findings for the study of the role of defense mechanisms in personality configurations and their susceptibility to depression, as well as for the use of multisource assessment strategies in the study of personality, are discussed.

Men appear to have a greater tendency to agree with beliefs that encourage nonuse of condoms. There was evidence to suggest that a holder of an attitude in one area such as cultural belief is likely to hold a similar attitude in almost all other areas. The implication of this finding for theory development is that attitudes are not independent of each other. The implications for policy action are straightforward: an effective strategy for attacking the negative attitudes should put emphasis on men and be broadly educative in the sense of attacking several attitudes simultaneously, rather than one at a time.},

The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-R, 48 items, Eysenck, Eysenck, & Barrett, 1985) was used to assess personality traits. One hundred psychology students (mean age 23.7) participated in the study. The majority (80%) of the students were females. The results revealed a strong positive relationship between neuroticism (N) on one hand and somatic symptoms, anxiety and depression on the other hand. Extraversion (E) was negatively related to anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms and social dysfunction. No significant sex or age difference was found in psychological disturbances measured by the GHQ or in personality traits - apart from a positive association between E and age. Unlike studies carried out in other countries which showed females to be more anxious and more neurotic, the present study did not find sex differences in anxiety and neuroticism. When a cutoff point of 4 was used, 20% of the students were classified as psychiatric cases.

  abstract = {This study addressed children's perceptions and explanations of verbal and cognitive intelligence. A group of primary-school children (N=119) from the second, the fourth, and the sixth grades were asked to choose the best pupils of their respective classes in their mother tongue (native language) and mathematics and to give reasons for their choices. In the mother tongue, the children tended to favor their own gender in their choices, and boys and girls were chosen as the best pupils quite evenly. In mathematics, the boys selected only boys from the second grade on, while the girls started selecting mostly boys from the fourth grade on only. In the mother tongue the consensus was low, and the choices were explained by referring to the pupil's positive classroom behavior and appropriate work habits. But in mathematics the consensus was high, and the choices were explained by referring to the formal academic recognition that the best pupil had attained and to the speed and correctness of his/her performance. These findings seemed to suggest that mathematical ability is personified as a masculine domain and that our culture's gender-bound representation of mathematical ability may well be inherent to the routines of the school institution.},

It is suggested that the current concept of situational ambiguity may be extended by examining distinctive underlying factors that mediate the expression of racism: task specificity and target specificity. It is argued that a significant amount of research on racism, and its expression, has been conducted through the use of a mock-juror paradigm and, as such, two studies were conducted to investigate the degree to which task and target specificity influence the guilt ratings of mock jurors. In Study 1, target specificity was manipulated by varying the race and social-status level of the defendant being evaluated. In Study 2, task specificity was manipulated by varying the presence or absence of jury instructions and the subsequent interactive effects of task and target specificity were examined. Results suggest that guilt ratings were significantly more affected by target and task specificity than by race per se, although there were race effects on ratings. Interestingly, task specificity appeared to affect responses only when target specificity was lacking. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of their contribution to the concept of modern racism.},

In this study, participants from the Netherlands and the United States read short, realistic descriptions of each system and answered questions about the fairness of both procedures. Results indicated that while the adversarial system was rated significantly higher on the likelihood that all evidence will be presented, and the likelihood that both the victim and the defendant will get an opportunity to voice their cases, people showed a clear preference for their own system. This bias toward one justice system over another may be due to the cultural values reflected in each system.},

  abstract = {The recognition that sexual desire is associated with relationship quality and other important interpersonal experiences has led to a corresponding interest in identifying the correlates and causes of this aspect of human sexual response. Most researchers have focused on intraindividual factors, including hormonal processes. The present review explores the relationship between one hormonally mediated female life event - pregnancy - and sexual desire. Sexual desire is defined, and distinguished from other sexual experiences (e.g., arousal, activity), and its common operationalizations are disscussed. Next, the hormonal changes that characterize each trimester of pregnancy are considered. Empirical research conducted then to determine whether these hormonal changes correspond to alterations in the experience of desire is then reviewed. It is concluded that the hormonal fluctuations that occur during pregnancy are reliably associated with progressive decreases in feelings of sexual desire in the majority of women.},

There are vast differences within different Arab cultures which may converge and diverge to form what is sometimes "lumped together" as Arab culture. The paper also attempts to delineate some of the cultural barriers that may be significant in explaining a set of mechanisms that facilitate or hinder the seeking of psychological help by Arab patients within given psychotherapeutic relationships. Issues of cultural transference and countertransference are briefly discussed. Case studies are given to illustrate how to overcome such difficulties, especially when they pertain to therapeutic encounters between Arab patients and their Western therapists and the ensuing role expectations and role confusions.},

There is a pattern of greater acceptance for students from clinical psychology programs, with students from counseling psychology programs accepted somewhat less frequently, and students from school psychology programs being most often rejected. The results suggest that internship selectors may use a judgment heuristic that clinical psychology students are more suited to internships than are counseling and - especially - school psychology students during initial screening of internship applicants, even though there is no empirical evidence to support the hueristic.

This study examines the association between the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ; Heinberg, Thompson, & Stormer, 1995), a measure of internalization and awareness of the thin ideal, and eating and body image concerns in college women. Seventy undergraduates completed questionnaires on eating symptomatology, body image and demographics. In general, inernalization, but not awareness, of the thin ideal was associated with eating and weight concerns. In two-way analysis of body mass and dichotomized SATAQ internalization scores, body mass moderated the effects of internalization, with over-weight women high in internalization having the most body image concerns. Prospectively, SATAQ-internalization scores predicted increasing drive for thinness over the school year in a subsample of women. Future research should explore the moderating effects of weight on outcomes related to internalization of the thin ideal.},

However, despite apparent temperamental similarities between adaptors and individuals with a high need to achieve (e.g., both groups are conforming and persistent, and prefer moderate levels of risk), the hypothesis that adaptors would have higher levels of achievement motivation than innovators was not supported, possibly due to shortcomings inherent in Mehta's (1969) Achievement Motivation Inventory and/or difficulties in adapting Mehta's instrument for this research.},

Determination of factors in job stress is important, because it will help to prevent it. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of work-related stress with work life variables by using The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and Brief Coping Styles Inventory (BCSI). A survey was conducted among hospital staff of a university teaching hospital in Turkey. Response rate was 52.4 % (N=152). A questionnaire included 47 questions on sociodemographic variables and lifestyle. Nineteen questions were derived from the Work-life Evaluation Scales. Psychological symptom status was assessed with BSI. Coping styles with stress behavior was evaluated with BCSI. Most participants showed medium level BSI subscale scores, but global indexes were at a higher level. Females had higher depression and anxiety scores than did males; graduates of university programs (mostly nurses) had higher somatisation, obsessive compulsive interpersonal sensitivity, depression, hostility, paranoid ideation, global severity index, positive symptom total and positive symptom distress index scores than did other respondents of other educational levels, staff who were employed by the university (i.e., residents and nurses) had higher BSI symptom scores. In conclusion, even though the respondents did not seem generally to be dissatisfied concerning their work-life, the majority of staff had depressive symptoms and were distressed. Nurses and residents in particular, should receive counseling concerning coping styles with stress.},

Within the broad concept of mastery beliefs, differential aspects of self-regulatory cognitions were studied, that is self-esteem, control beliefs, effort to complete behavior, persistence in the face of adversity, and willingness to initiate behavior. Effects of these aspects on carrying out activities were investigated and controlled for the impact of some situational and demographic factors. Findings suggest that a general sense of mastery, as reflected in self-esteem and control beliefs, is not a precondition for study and volunteering work in the third age. However, special components of self-efficacy turned out to play a part. Willingness to initiate behavior emerged to be a strong predictor for taking on educational activities, persistence in the face of adversity for being active as a volunteer. In the discussion possibilities were looked at of how better to match productive activities in later life to personal dispositions.},

One hundred and fifteen students completed a survey on the aggression they experienced from others over the course of summer employment. A hierarchical regression analysis provided support for all propositions. Aggression experienced at work was significantly predicted by job risk factors, the target's self-esteem and the number of hours worked per week, with the latter contributing an 8% increment in predicted variance.},

Moreover, bipolar and unipolar illness were found in the relatives of unipolar patients only. Thus affective illness in the first degree of relatives of bipolar patients was more than 30%. Genetic transmission was also found in linkage relationship. Chromosomal studies have also been reported. Phenotypic variations have also been found responsible for affective illness.

The goal was to investigate whether or not different linguistic styles could be correlated to the cognitive complexity of the task as regards the truth bias or lie bias of the recipient. Specifically, two sets of linguistic aspects - micro and macro structural - were analyzed. In the former, indices were considered as words (arguments number, repetitions and interruptions, fluency and fluency disorder indices), predicates (number, nominal/predicative construction and personal/impersonal structure), pronouns and adverbial forms. In the latter, the structural variations of the standard phrase, utterances' complexity, spatial organization of utterances and speech organization were analyzed. Results showed that participants used speech to shield from reality and chose different strategies; in the L1 condition, participants resorted to ambiguity and prolixity ("cuttlefish effect"); on the contrary, in the L2 condition they used concise assertiveness and elliptic eluding strategies ("chameleon effect").},

Myth acceptance decreased with the number of psychology courses that students had taken in university, but increased with the number that they had taken in junior college. Belief in myths was lower among students who were majoring in psychology, were older, had higher grades, and had advanced training in research methods, but it was not related to gender, geographical origin, or university year.

The first two types show negative impacts on their members, while the third one has a positive impact. The study has found that the enmeshed type is dominant in Arab society, a fact that reflects various problems, such as escaping to another reality, hyperactivity, deviance, school failure and aggression, It was concluded that the first problem was related to the development of norms within the family development. The second problem was double-bind communication, which produces schizophrenic personality among children. The third problem was caused by the imbalance of power among the members. The fourth problem was marriage stability, in which four categories of marriage were produced. Recommendations and suggestions are offered to enhance the status of the Arabic family.},

The treatment more than doubled subjects' mean serum testosterone level. Testosterone reduced positive affect in both sexes and led to more attractive dress among women but not among men.

The results show a positive correlation between risk taking and sensation seeking and a negative correlation between risk evaluation and sensation seeking.

Using a merged data set, based on 7,477 full-time workers, weighted logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationships between eight occupational and job dimensions and workers' current and prior use of alcohol and drugs. Results show that steady employment or job security has the most pronounced negative effect on alcohol and drug use, while characteristics such as the pace of activity, job independence, and skills utilization to include feelings of accomplishment have little or no effect on employees' alcohol and drug use. Furthermore, the etiology of cocaine use appears quite different from that of alcohol and other types of drug use: All else being equal, employees' odds of using cocaine, when working in an occupation with greater job variety, decrease by 64 percent. However, employees in occupations with greater job autonomy are about 4 times more likely to use cocaine than are employees in jobs with less autonomy. These findings suggest that occupational conditions have a discernible influence on alcohol and drug use among employees, albeit in more complex ways than those suggested by much of the organizational stress and occupational subcultural literature.},

Participants were then asked to rate the guilt of the defendant in two ways: (1) on a 7-point bipolar scale in accordance with their personal beliefs (i.e., Subjective Guilt Rating), and (2) on a dichotomous scale (guilty/not guilty) in accordance with judicial instructions (i.e., Legal Standard Guilt Rating). Participants were also asked to rate the victim and defendant on a number of personality traits. Results indicate that participants asked to rate the degree of guilt of the defendant according to the Subjective Guilt Rating found him more guilty if he was French, or Native Canadian as opposed to English Canadian. These prejudicial ratings, however, dissipated when participants were asked to rate the guilt of the defendant according to the Legal Standard Guilt Rating that included jury instructions.

Each participant was assessed on a battery of different questionnaires including: background variables, Change and Stability, Life Orientation test, Coping Resources Inventory and the Gordon personal profile and inventory. There was no change in Dispositional optimism or ten other related personality traits. Only four of the personality variables were altered on completion of the training program: the participants' self-evaluations were elevated, the stability of their norms and system of values was reinforced, their emotional stability was reinforced also, and their receptivity to new ideas/innovations was reinforced. These results are discussed in the context of the relative constancy of personality characteristics and the suitability of the observed changes, after the 12-month program, in promoting strategies of coping behavior.},

This paper reports the construction and validation of the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale (SRIS) which is designed to be an advance on the Private Self-Consciousnes Scale (PrSCS; Fenigstein, Scheier, & Buss, 1975). Previous work has found the PrSCS to comprise two factors, self-reflection and internal state awareness. In a series of studies two separate factor analyses found the SRIS comprised two separate factors labeled Self-Reflection (SRIS-SR) and Insight (SRIS-IN). "Need for self-reflection" and "engagement in self-reflection" loaded on the same factor. Test-retest reliability over a 7-week period was .77 (SRIS-SR) and .78 (SRIS-IN). The PrSCS correlated positively with the SRIS-SR and negatively with the SRIS-IN. The SRIS-SR correlated positively with anxiety and stress, but not with depression and alexithymia. The SRIS-IN was negatively correlated with depression, anxiety, stress and alexithymia, and positively correlated with cognitive flexibility and self-regulation. Individuals who had kept diaries had higher SRIS-SR scores but lower SRIS-IN scores than did those who had not kept diaries. Implications of these findings for models of self-regulation and goal attainment are discussed.},

One task involved sorting fourteen racial type labels and rating the sorted piles on four scales (e.g., respectable-not respectable). The second task involved generating attributes that described a randomly selected racial type. Both tasks provided data that could be used as input for multidimensional-scaling and hierarchical-clustering analyses. Further, the data from the adjective-generation task was used as input for a discriminant-function analysis. It was predicted that the different data collection and analysis tasks would produce results that emphasized the importance of evaluation in racial-type perception but that the sorting task Would reveal more prejudice against Black targets.

Negative emotional and sexual experiences were the trauma variables that contributed most to this relationship, whereas a tendency to be aware of feelings toward family and about mortality were the dimensions of introspection that added most to this association. Prior trauma history, dissociation, introspectiveness, and emotional distress were significantly interrelated. The data from a path analysis performed suggest that introspectiveness may be better explained by the independent effect of dissociation rather than directly by trauma or by emotional distress.

Using three blocks of variables, an attempt was made to explain the amount of instability in the care and the changes seen between the times t1 (1991) and t2 (1997). Their three blocks of variables represented the father's social and cultural context at t1, the father's value orientation at t1, and the father's family of origin, respectively. It was concluded that for an increase in caring fatherhood in the 1990s, the father's context was far more important than was his value orientation. Some aspects of a father's family of origin are also important: a good relationship with his own father is positively associated with the continuation of, or increase in, caring fatherhood.},

One class received hypnotic induction procedures to visualize an alter self and the second class was exposed to false-identity constructions under imagination conditions. Participants reported on the appearance of their false identity outside operational contexts and on the reenactment of a false identity in other police officers. Self-reported identity reappearances were more likely to be found among persons scoring higher on the Dissociative Experiences Scale and by persons who altered their physical appearance. Despite expectations to the contrary operators were not more likely than coverpersons to report uncontrolled reappearances of their false identity. Observer-reported false identity reenactments were correlated with self-reports of identity reappearances outside operational contexts. Coverpersons who were more frequently observed to reenact their undercover persona also reported the strongest tendency to reexperience their false-identity. The visualization of an undercover self through imagination exercises and the tendency to use these methods for dissimulations in the field was associated with greater false identity manifestations as reported by observers. Cognitive factors and possibly strain from status inconsistencies appear to underlie these identity disturbances.},

Data were deductively analyzed using existing reversal theory definitions of the telic (a serious-minded and future orientation) and paratelic (a spontaneous, playful orientation) states and the factors proposed to induce reversals between these states. Reversals in state were observed and these were caused mainly by contingent events (factors external to the individual). None was attributed to satiation (a change in state caused by experiencing only one state for an extended time period) and a limited number were attributed to frustration, which also combined with contingent events to induce some reversals. Although further evidence is presented for metamotivational state reversals during sport, future longitudinal studies are needed that address all reversal theory states.},

The basic assumptions of the new theory are preceded by theoretical analysis of the contemporary "methodological market" of personological formulations. The paper discusses the so-called clinical (deductive) and scientific (inductive) approaches to elaborating personality theories as well as integrative attempts of trait theorists to find "the golden mean" between objectivity and universal structure of personality, among which the basic models are the 16PF, the PEN, and the B5. As analysis shows, although at present some universal personality constructions are revealed, they mostly represent dimensional taxonomies which are hierarchical at best. Such formulations cannot be called personality theories in their proper sense because they can be used basically for descriptive purposes - being incapable of explaining causes of behavior or of predicting the direction of purposeful activity. The language personality theory proposed in the paper is based on theoretical assumptions of a different, nontraditional variant of the fundamental lexical hypothesis, encoded in the language which focuses on the essential similarities of people, not on their dissimilarities. Additional perennial philosophical ground and linguistic conception of semantic primitives allow the theory to have the structure, dimensional taxonomy, and quality of universality.},

Undergraduates (N = 647) enrolled in eight sections of Introduction to Psychology received a recruitment message for volunteering through a campus-based program. Following exposure to the recruitment message, students completed a questionnaire and two months later the enrollment records of the campus-based program were checked. Consistent with the theory of planned behavior, attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control predicted intent - and intent, in turn, predicted volunteer enrollment in the campus-based program. However, less than 33% of the students with the maximum possible intention score of six subsequently enrolled to volunteer in the campus-based program.},

To date, an unpredictability schema has been measured indirectly with scales that tap a variety of interrelated beliefs. Measures of such beliefs show associations with risk taking. An unpredictability schema, thus, may be an overlooked factor in risk-taking behavior. The present model takes a multidisciplinary approach and makes two major contributions. First, it integrates psychological constructs that have not previously been linked. Second, it clarifies existing relationships among background characteristics and risk-related outcomes.

As in previous research, love-styles characterized as obsessive and game-playing displayed associations with certain disordered eating attitudes. However, factors that related to the family's attitude toward physical appearance as based on weight showed stronger statistical associations with eating attitudes than did love-styles. While these results provide some support for romantic interpersonal relationships being a neglected aspect in studies of risk factors for eating disorders, how physical appearance is routinely discussed at family mealtimes during a young woman's childhood may be a stronger index of her maladaptive attitudes toward food and dieting.},

The frequency of drinking "to excess" also increased greatly over this interval. Smoking has decreased to minimal levels, and now shows no sign of modeling effects, but self-serving bias now occurs, since respondents today report themselves as smoking fewer cigarettes than their friends.},

This study assessed the extent to which variables associated with self-presentation approaches to shyness and social support mediated the association between shyness and loneliness. Two hundred and fifty-five American college students completed self-report measures of shyness, loneliness, expectations of rejection, interpersonal competence and close social support. A path analysis indicated that high levels of shyness were related to features of a protective style of self-presentation (perceived deficits in interpersonal competence, heightened expectations of rejection). In turn, low levels of interpersonal competence predicted reductions in social support. Together, measures indicative of a protective self-presentation style and reductions in social support predicted increases in loneliness. However, shyness and loneliness had a significant association, even after controlling for the influence of self-presentation and social support. Findings suggest that although features of protective self-presentation and social support may partially explain the association between shyness and loneliness, shyness and loneliness are also directly related.},

Furthermore, their attitudes towards two technology items (high-speed trains and nuclear power) were registered. An optimal scaling procedure (OVERALS) was used for analyzing the cultural and gender-specific differences with regard to the mindscape types. Group differences in the high-tech attitudes were tested by means of Chi-square analyses. The meaning of the results is discussed from the viewpoints of hypothesis testing as contrasted to the construction of an open-ended taxonomy.},

Factor analysis revealed two factors labeled cognitive ability and dexterity.

Regressing seven demographic factors onto the overall score showed the participants' wealth, education and political beliefs to be the best predictors: richer, longer educated, more right-wing people thought they had higher IQ scores.},

Before the experiment, each participant's tendency to use active or passive coping strategies was assessed by a questionnaire. The results showed that passive coping was related to blink rate, anxiety, and nervousness. Active coping was related to nervousness. Based on the median score for passive coping, participants were classified as high (n=37) or low (n=41). The high group had a significantly increased blink rate and anxiety level compared to the low group. Passive coping strategies increased nervousness; however, active coping strategies may have had a moderating effect on nervousness.},

Various personhood attributes are identified along the three dimension such as that the traditional person is socialized primarily by people, while the modern person is socialized primarily by objects.

As expected children were more likely to consider conflicts as results of mutual factors than of individual influence (p< .0001). Also, more children considered causes of conflicts to be of an impermanent rather than of a stable nature (p< .01).

Significant differences were found between the middle-class Portuguese and Lebanese students on the individualistic and fatalistic dimensions. Middle-class Lebanese students were significantly more fatalistic than their Portuguese counterparts. Furthermore, middle-class Lebanese students documented greater individualistic interpretations of poverty than did Portuguese. MANCOVA test, which used class crossed with nationality on the poverty dimensions, and gender as a covariate did not yield significant differences between means. Wilks' Lambda regression coefficient showed a significant interaction between-class and nationality on the fatalistic dimension. Although the results portray different scores of poverty from those in previous studies, Lebanese students' structuralistic attributions are explained by the present economic and social crises of their country which transcend a strong orientation of system blame.

Using the Stress Processing Report (SPR), 216 females reported symptoms of stress, illness, and significant stressful life events. Scores on four dimensions (self, others, process and goals) were significantly lower in the individuals with the auto-immune disorder when compared to the control group of 277 females from the general population. The sample group was then divided into high and low stress groups by the number of subjective symptoms of stress reported. Scores were found to be significantly lower in the high stress group when compared to the low stress group. Results indicate that individuals with the auto-immune disorder have more dysfunctional thinking patterns than the general population, and that these patterns correlate with the severity of their subjective complaints. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Only for children at ages 35 did negative descriptors associated with the so-called "little emperor" stereotype prevail in parents' free descriptions. On the other hand, the proportion of negative descriptors in the Conscientiousness category increased with children's age. This was an indication of the persisting importance given by Chinese parents to characteristics associated with school performance, effort, and diligence. The results showed that there were no signs of a spoiling attitude in Chinese parents.

This tendency can be interpreted as reflecting either a desire to maintain a positive social identity or an application of equity. An experiment was conducted in order to examine the roles of these two factors. The independent variables were status (high vs. low), and the nature of the relation between the dimension on which status was defined and the dimension on which in-group bias was measured (relation, no relation). When the two dimensions were related, equity was expected to be relevant. Therefore it was predicted that the status differential would be reproduced through the allocations. Contrary to this hypothesis, neither the high nor the low status group displayed in-group favoritism in this condition. The authors suggest that the use of two related dimensions rather than only one, as in previous studies, is responsible for such a discrepancy. It was further predicted that when the two dimensions were unrelated, equity would be irrelevant and therefore members of both groups would display in-group bias on the new dimension-either as a means of preserving a positive social identity or in order to achieve one.

The PRF inter-scale correlations matched those of U.S. college students except for an unexpectedly high correlation between Affiliation and Nurturance.

  abstract = {This study evaluated the relationship between several dimensions of parental and family religiosity with adolescent drug use behavior. Analysis was based on self-reported responses to a questionnaire administered to 1,036 undergraduate college students at Brigham Young University, of which 99.1% are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS). About 86% reported having never used drugs. The most commonly reported reasons for abstention from drugs were that drug use violates the participants' religious beliefs and their personal moral code. In contrast, concern about legal consequences, harming family reputation, and avoiding dishonest behavior were among the least common reasons for abstaining from drugs. Children of parents who were neutral, versus critical, about religion - or who considered religion of minor importance -were more likely to have a history of drug use. Protective factors against drug behavior included also parental positions of responsibility in the church and frequent family discussions involving religion and Christian conduct. The mother's view of religion was a stronger indicator of previous drug use behavior than either the father's view of religion, positions of church responsibility held by the parents, or arguments about religious teachings with parents. Discussion on topics of Christian conduct was a stronger indicator of previous drug use behavior than were either church attendance or discussions on topics of religious doctrine. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Retest reliability of the questionnaire was acceptably high (r = 0.872). The study presented here examines some relationships between factors as measured by two screening questions and by follow-up questions and the BQ scores. In the screening questions, for example, it was found that those who had had psychotherapy or had taken dream courses had significantly thinner boundaries than those who had not. This relationship did not hold, though, for those who said they paid attention to their dreams. Further questions in the follow-up phase showed also that those with thinner boundaries were more concerned with dreams. It was not clear, however, why indecisive persons in this elderly population sample should have thinner boundaries nor why those with thinner boundaries are more discontented with their bodily situations and/or with their family situations. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

When an individual performs a task, the individual's performance may be subject to two types of evaluation: self-evaluation and evaluation by others. Often, the basis of evaluation is the performance of others, i.e., social comparison. In such cases, an individual may increase performance to protect self-and social-esteem. Further, the individual's sensitivity to esteem threats, as measured by identity orientation, may moderate the performance increase. This study examined performance in two evaluative situations: peer groups and goal setting. Experimental results support the proposed theory in the case of peer evaluations. Regarding goals, results suggest that self-evaluation may not contribute to performance increases associated with goal setting. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The TRSA-"junior" (Teacher Rating Scale of Social Anxiety-"junior") is a brief Likert-type questionnaire for the identification of social anxiety in 5-to 6-year-old children. Reliability (internal consistency plus test-retest correlation) collected in 2 samples was high. Convergent and divergent validity of this newly developed rating-scale were also studied. A high level of social anxiety correlated with a low level of social participation, as observed on the playground. The TRSA-"junior" score correlated with "internalizing" as measured by the Behavior Questionnaire for Toddlers and Preschoolers (BQTP) and the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL), and with the subscales "anxious-depressed", "thought problems", "social problems" and "withdrawn behavior" of the CBCL. In the second study a high score on social anxiety appeared to be related to less positive sociometric judgments by peers. The authors conclude that the TRSA-"junior" may aid in the identification and prevention of social anxiety at an early age. In addition, the scale would appear to be a useful instrument in research, given its sound psychometric qualities. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Racism implies that a definitive social/psychological process exists through which individuals are categorised, despite the fact that there is often no clear delineation, and this causes chaos in setting evaluative parameters for the structuring of this categorisation process. A non-racial world can exist only if theories and postulations re race are rendered irrelevant. Subsequent to the 1994 South African elections, it became imperative to do this. This artificially polarized society had the opportunity to develop racial unity and hegemony. To assess the relative status of racist paradigms in students, 265 students completed a questionnaire which attempted to measure ethnic group identification and particular interracial attitudes. Results were disappointing, indeed distressing. Significant indications of racist stereotypes were found in all racial groups, with a strong bias towards subjects' own racial groups. The primary conclusion is that racist perceptions and stereotypes remain very prevalent and active in the South African society. A number of recommendations to address the issue are made, e.g. school curricula should include particular components to develop greater understanding/sensitivity re other racial groups; social emphasis should be on cultural solidarity rather than on cultural diversity; national governments should contribute funding towards setting up an international forum to study/combat racism, etc. The concept of race, and the existence of the phenomenon in the minds of perceivers, must be attacked and discarded on an international level if the world is to achieve a state of racial harmony. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

In the second study, 240 respondents estimated the attitudes of a young, middle-aged, or old male or female target. Evidence of an "old-is-conservative" stereotype was clearest among young participants. Among old participants, the stereotype was evident only when the target was male. People associated traditional liberalism more with women than with men and radical liberalism more with men than with women. Both kinds of liberalism were expected to decrease with age.

Students who are failing in their courses scored significantly higher in neurosis and extraversion than did their population group.

Results indicated that language plays a primary role in individuals' orientations; respondents who used the Arabic language were consistently more collectivist than those who used either English or French. The discussion focused on the role of second language, specifically, English or French, which when learned by Arabic native speakers, enhanced the accessibility of private self-cognitions.

The data were collected in a primary school in the Netherlands where four teachers and 87 pupils, ranging from grade 2 to 5 (aged 7 to 10 years), participated in this study. The teachers appeared to make use of the same pupil characteristics and the same scale levels in judging their pupils. These teachers generated pupil characteristics that included sociability, self-confidence, troublesomeness and working attitude, which correspond substantially to the Big Five. However, it was found that teachers are not particularly accurate in judging their pupils. Except for 'troublesomeness', there was little correspondence between teachers' ratings of pupils and the behavior of those pupils in the classroom, observed independently by 'naive' observers. Clearly, teacher judgments are very important and often play a decisive role in children's school careers. Higher levels of agreement and - in particular - accuracy are therefore needed in teachers' judgments. This study implies that specific elaborations of the central constructs of the critical realistic approach to personality judgment agreement and accuracy can be useful in describing and assessing judgments made by individual teachers. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

In this study, 103 elementary school children rated videotapes of toy commercials or slides of toys on perceived aggressiveness, stereotypic sex-role behavior, gender-based appropriateness and imagined play with the toys depicted. Girls rated imagined play with boy-toys as being more aggressive than did boys, and boys rated girl-toys more appropriate for girls than did girls. All commercials were rated as demonstrating stereotypic sex-role behavior. Male-focused commercials and imagined toy play with the boy-toys depicted were rated more aggressive than were female-focused and neutral commercials, and their respective toys. At the same time, boy-toys were rated by both girls and boys as more desirable than girl-toys. The results suggest that boys are particular targets of aggressive content in marketing and are more desensitized to aggressive content than are girls. Though girls perceived more aggressiveness than did boys, the aggressive toys remained highly desirable. Thus, aggressive content in toy commercials appears attractive, especially to boys, but also to girls. Since children's programming is saturated with toy commercials, young viewers are at best reinforced by stereotypic sex-role behavior, and at worst, inundated with violent content. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

We expected that men would more often adopt a "wide" sitting position (legs apart and arms away from the trunk), while women would more often adopt a "closed" sitting position (upper legs against each other and arms against the trunk) and that these sitting positions would generally be seen as masculine or feminine. In the first study the sitting positions of men and women travelling on the Amsterdam Metro (underground railway) were observed. The results showed that men more often sat in a wide position, while women more often displayed a closed sitting position. In the second study, photos of men and women sitting in a wide or a closed position were judged. The results showed that a wide sitting position was considered more masculine and a closed position more feminine. We expected also that (in)consistency between gender and sitting position would have an impact on the impression gained of the stimulus person. The results lend support to this expectation. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

  abstract = {© Society for Personality Research (Inc.) The aims of this study were to find out the degree of loneliness among Portuguese adolescents from immigrant backgrounds in Switzerland, and the factors that may predict the level of loneliness among them. Portuguese immigration to Switzerland is a recent phenomenon with relatively high rates of immigrants. Three hypotheses were tested: loneliness scores of Portuguese adolescents living in Switzerland are not different from those of Portuguese adolescents living in Portugal; variables within each one of the three sets taken into account - socio-demographic, intercultural contact and psychosocial adjustment - will be predictors of loneliness; and the variables of intercultural contact and psychosocial adjustment will be more predictive of loneliness than socio-demographic variables will be. The study sample consisted of 95 subjects (mean age = 16.1 years; SD = 1.84). The mean duration of sojourn in Switzerland for the sample was 7.2 years (SD = 4.1 ). They were asked to fill in a questionnaire with several measures, including socio-demographic information, ethnic language proficiency, majority language proficiency, ethnic identity, majority identity, perceived discrimination, stressful experience, adaptation, mastery, self-esteem, symptoms outcome and loneliness. A control group involving 363 Portuguese youth was included in the study. The hypotheses were supported. There were no significant differences between Portuguese adolescents living in Portugal and in Switzerland in terms of level of loneliness. Socio-demographic, intercuttural contact and psychosocial adjustment variables accounted for 35% of the variance explained. Majority language proficiency was the most important predictor of loneliness. Implications of the study for counsellors are suggested.},

The data show an increase in the value placed on socially extrinsic outcomes (specifically income) and a decrease in the value placed on socially intrinsic outcomes (specifically those mediated by marriage, kin contact, neighborly interaction, fraternal and church group membership). These trends raise questions about a possible imbalance in the pursuit of extrinsic over intrinsic outcomes, and possible deleterious social psychological consequences.

Three hundred and thirty-three healthy subjects (217 women and 116 men) with a wide range of occupations attended this study and were divided into 5 age ranges. They were free of depression and answered with low dissimulation in ZKPQ. The principal component analysis detected 16 factors with eigenvalues larger than 1.5, the first 5 of which accounted for 21.0% of the variance. The five-factor solution analysis was, therefore, performed. The alpha internal reliabilities of the five personality scales ranged from 0.61 to 0.81. Sixty-one out of 89 items loaded larger than, or equal to, 0.3 on target factors. Scale scores were comparable to those reported in the United States, and the intercorrelations between five personality scales were lower. Gender and education level had little effect on the personality measures; the Impulsive Sensation Seeking declined with age only from 20 years on, in women. This study demonstrates the validity of the ZKPQ in Chinese culture. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The presence of personality disorders also has a negative influence on the social functioning of depressed patients, and it has emerged that certain demographic characteristics are present to a significant extent This article presents the results of a study of 244 out-patients suffering from major depression. The issues addressed were: Firstly, which axis II disorders are found in this group and are there correlations with the demographic characteristics? Secondly, is there a relationship between individual axis II disorders and the severity of the depression and social functioning? It emerges that 60% of the patients with a Hamilton score of at least 14 have one or more axis II disorders according to the VKP self-report, and that 30% have three or more, with more than 50% in cluster C. It was found also that the schizoid and borderline personality disorders in particular are significantly linked to several demographic characteristics. The patients here are more often single and those with a lower level of education. Using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, little significant correlation was found between the presence of an axis II disorder and the severity of the depression. A significant difference was found using the Symptom Check List -90. In social functioning, the citizen role, the social role and the family role turn out to be correlated most significantly, as are the total number of impairments. In addition, the highest correlation is found particularly in cluster C, and the number of axis II disorders is almost always significantly related to the individual roles. The discussion turns to the influence of the measuring instruments used and to the composition of the population, as well as the clinical relevance of the diagnosis of axis II disorders and social functioning in patients with a major depression. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The study used written scenarios to investigate subjects' reactions while waiting with strangers in line at the movie theater. Results indicated that when compared with low public subjects, high public subjects had more self-related thoughts, reported more negative evaluation of the waiting experience and attributed controllability for the cause of waiting to the service provider. High public subjects had significantly different cognitive and affective reactions from those of low public subjects when the cause of waiting was related to an intrusion occurring immediately in iront of them, rather than when it was related to an inappropriate behavior of the service provider. © Society for Personality Raearch (Inc.).},

  abstract = {Issues concerning the effectiveness of promotional activities for working people's occupational safety and health are the focus of the present study. Data were collected from a random sample of 668 working people in Hong Kong by the telephone survey method. The study relies on a framework of social cognitive theory, which posits mediational roles of beliefs concerning one's self-efficacy, the collective efficacy of the promotional organization, and the efficacy of behavior for occupational safety and health. It involves a causal model incorporating exposure, learning, efficacy beliefs, actual and intended behavior, work accident, occupation and other background characteristics, and prior scores of self-efficacy, behavior, and accident. Analysis of the causal model reveals the significant contribution of promotional activities, through the social learning process of exposure, learning, and development of efficacy beliefs, to behavioral change. That is, the total effects of exposure and learning on behavioral outcomes and their mediators were significant. Moreover, working people in industries targeted for promotion demonstrated higher levels of behavior and efficacy beliefs than those in non-targeted industries. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Results indicated that dissociation was highest among current bulimics, and that past bulimics had lower levels of dissociation than current bulimics (although higher than non-bulimic controls). However, there was no association between level of dissociation and incidence of reported childhood sexual abuse. In addition, the incidence of childhood sexual abuse was no higher among bulimics than among the general population - although the severity of the abuse was reported to have been higher. The severity of self-reported childhood sexual abuse was also found to be higher among current bulimics than among past bulimics.

The pattern of correlations indicated that SC in various areas becomes more differentiated with age. Self-concept dimensions were more distinct for junior high students than for elementary students. SDQ-I subscales were more reliable with junior high students (range: .V2-.94) than with elementary students (range: .74-.90).

The study involved a total of 2706 adolescents.

Results showed that all the three domains of family environment (relationship, personal growth, and system maintenance) correlated significantly with the three depression aspects (emotionality, lack of positive experience, and physiological irritation). The relationship domain of FES appeared to correlate more strongly than the other two domains with the depression aspects. The FES domains also correlated strongly and positively with the four domains of self-concept: academic, appearance, social, and general. Both the relationship domain and system maintenance domain correlated more strongly than the personal growth domain with the self-concept domains. Regression analyses showed that family relationship was most predictive of various aspects of depression and self-concept. Sex difference was found in the prediction of both boys' and girls' depression and self-concept. With boys, system maintenance was predictive only of self-concept. With girls, personal growth was predictive of depression, and personal growth and system maintenance were predictive of self-concept. Analysis of variance showed that students high on family relationship, personal growth, and system maintenance were low in different depression aspects, but high in various self-concept domains. It was concluded that a cohesive, orderly, and achieving family environment is conducive to more positive development in adolescents, in terms of lower depression and higher self-concept. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

This was examined by the assessment of the shift in egograms of a teacher's students, as measured by the Interpersonal Check List (ICL). A 2 × 9 doubly multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted on the adult, parent, and child ego states as self-assessed by 187 students prior to the class period and after the class period, but still within the presence of the teacher. As hypothesized, the Time and the Class by Time results were statistically significant (p < .05), indicating a general preclass to postclass change in ego state. The multivariate effect sizes averaged about .065, which is subtle but detectible. The change in ego states were also significant (p = 0.018) when assessed by a singly-ordered row by column table, in terms of the number of students within each class who presented either an increase or decrease in the number of items representative of the Adult, Parent, or Child ego states on the ICL. The shift in ego state was also evidenced by the decrease (average Spearman's rho = .45) in pre-post correlation (i.e., with the teacher in the classroom), as compared with test-retest (i.e., study hall with no teacher present) correlation (average rho of .86) of ego states. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

In total, 34 factor analyses were performed, each involving the inclusion, together with the data set in question, of a different one of the 17 organizational variables which were employed. Affect anxiety (DMTm) was found in factors together with ratings of the organizational variables of openness/diversity, developmental orientation, planning/clarity, workload pressure (negative sign), personal attitude toward the superior, change-centeredness of the superior and organizational climate. Identity anxiety (DMTm) was found in a factor together with organizational climate (negative sign); repression 3 (DMTm) in a factor together with academic values, human orientation and formalization/centralization (negative sign); projected introaggression (DMTm) in a factor together with employee-centeredness of the superior (negative sign); and denial through reversal III (DMTm) in a factor together with structural orientation, formalization/centralization and sufficiency of resources (negative sign).

The use of specific strategies of coping was also determined by both the personality and the perception of the examination situation, wherein the different strategies were determined by different sets of variables. Success in the examination was best predicted by the social evaluation trait anxiety, by problem focused coping and by coping through imagination-rumination (negative relation).

Except for the maternal scale, subscales intercorrelated moderately with each other, also the reliability coefficients were good and comparable to those obtained by Harter. With respect to predictive validity, self-concept scores correlated only with achievement in the social domain and not with academic achievement.

Helping behavior was a function of the perceived controllability of the target's need for help and the helper's attributional style. While non-negligent targets were helped more than the negligent - supporting an attributional model of helping behavior (B. Weiner, 1980a, 1995) - the attributional style of potential helpers moderated that effect. Individuals with a supportive style helped a needy peer at the same rate irrespective of the controllability of the need. In contrast, unsupportive style individuals were very kind to the needy peer if the reason was legitimate, and highly neglectful if the peer was negligent. Thus, the causal structure of the situation was more influential in determining the behavior of unsupportive than supportive style respondents. The finding that attributional styles moderated helping reactions demonstrates that the attributional model of helping behavior is incomplete and that person variables must be considered in tandem with situational variables in attributional models of social behavior. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The results supported the hypothesized pattern of effects as persons with a high level of involvement with aggressive sports were particularly likely to believe that watching aggressive sports on television and in person can lead to a reduction in aggressive behavior. Also consistent with expectations, differences in beliefs in symbolic sport catharsis were not found between groups differing in their involvement with nonaggressive sports. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

  abstract = {This paper explores the validity of the Typical Intellectual Engagement (TIE) construct in relation to the five factor model (FFM) of personality and locus of control (LOC). Validity was initially explored in terms of the general TIE construct and its three facets (1) problem-directed thinking, (2) abstract thinking and (3) reading. A subsequent factor analytic exploration confirmed these three facets but suggested the existence of two others: (1) 'intellectual avoidance' and (2) 'intellectual pursuits as a primary focus'. 'Intellectual avoidance' is similar to Dweck's (1986) notion of maladaptive motivation. Using a sample of 281 participants a number of differential predictions were made and supported, for example: TIE 'problem-directed' thinking was the primary associate of both internal LOC and C, while TIE 'abstract thinking' was the primary associate of I. Further, TIE and both its facets/factors, but not I, were associated with LOC. It was argued, therefore, that while I and TIE are linked via abstract reasoning, they are measuring something distinct in terms of beliefs about personal agency. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The goal is to compare three different formalizations of balance (crossproduct, absolute difference, and quadratic effects of challenges and skills following a rotation of the predictor axes) with respect to how well each model predicts everyday life self-reports of feelings of concentration, which were obtained with the Experience Sampling Method from 208 talented high school students. Multilevel modeling with first-order autocorrelation structure is used throughout the model comparison. All models fitted reasonably well, accounting for nearly half of the variance. With reference to simple goodness-of-fit criteria, we conclude that both the rotated and the absolute difference models are to be preferred. Lastly, we discuss and compare the implications of the models for teaching, and outline extensions toward dynamic modeling and external modeling, by relating the subject specific effects of challenges and skills and of their balance with non-experiential variables such as personality traits and achievement measures. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Using the Organizational Commitment Scale (OCS), it was found that, amongst the participants, the discipline factor was more dominant than was the concern factor; however, motivation to update and develop organizations in which they were working was found to be the least important commitment expressed. Also the results showed no relationship between age and years of service on the one hand, and job commitment on the other; however, salary and educational level appeared to be significantly related with all OCS sub-scales except the discipline sub-scale. Results indicated also that those who were more satisfied in their jobs seemed to be more committed than those who were less satisfied, and females demonstrated more concern about their jobs than did male subjects - who used discipline as a way of expressing their commitment to their organizations. Employees working in firms which were managed by nationals were found to have higher commitment in the dimensions of discipline and concern. Moreover, married employees were more disciplined than were single ones. This study might provide some insights into the theoretical constructs predicting the organizational commitment of employees - which have yet to be shown to have cross-cultural validity. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Evaluations by high-prejudice participants were more negative than those of low-prejudice participants only when the applicant was described by a single negative stereotype; when descriptions contained more information that was negative and stereotypic racism was not a factor. In addition, responses of both groups became more extreme when more traits were provided, especially when traits were positive.

  abstract = {The situational context in which the serial killer targets his victims is critical to understanding the hunting patterns of a predator. However, police and researchers eschew victim target networks (VTN). Rather, their attention is overwhelmingly concerned with the offender's characteristics. As an alternative to traditional police investigations, this paper suggests that by directing attention to victim target networks, inferences about the decision-making process underlying the selection of crime locations, victims, and locating offenders' home bases can be made. The paper presents a decision- making model that the serial predator uses to scope out potential victim target networks and shows how proactive policing in victim target areas can deter the killer. The study also posits that by directing investigative attention to victim social networks, police can first identify a set of prospective victims targeted by a serial killer. The study closes with suggestions about the applicability of law enforcement use of victims' targeting networks and how victim social networks can be used to link serial murder victims. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Physicians' self-worth, on the other hand, has direct effects on practice behavior but not on their willingness to disclose uncertainty. In sum, physicians, who report higher levels of self-worth and less stress from uncertainty, show more effective and efficient practice behavior. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

In a second, experimental study (N = 53), evidence was found for the predictive validity of the GSS. In that study, subjects saw a slide series and were then confronted with leading questions about the critical (emotional) slide. In addition, they completed the Yield scale of the GSS.

Alternatively, a mismatch will decrease the attitude-behavior relation. If this model is correct then we would expect the match and mismatch effects only when attitudes are low in affective-cognitive consistency. The current study examined the effects of affective-cognitive consistency on this model. The degree of affective-cognitive consistency was manipulated by varying the degree of exposure to analytic puzzles.

The biases were not different by gender, but they were significantly different by race. Mean color attitudes of white children were significantly different from biracial children, such that the white children displayed a stronger pro-white/anti-black bias than the biracial children. Mean racial attitudes of white children were significantly different from black and biracial children, with white children showing more pro light-skinned bias than black and biracial children.

One way out of this debate is delineating paths through which the living environment affects outcome variables.

While past studies tended to demonstrate the mediating role of social support, they employed samples of college students only. By contrast, the present study investigates the mediating processes with a sample of 122 bedspace residents in Hong Kong. Results of hierarchical modeling illustrate that the adverse living environment affected the resident's psychosocial well-being indirectly. Notably, the objective living environment was related to the resident's perception of the environment, which in turn was related to social relations, characterized by social problems and social support. The perception and social relations were then related to the resident's depressive affect and loneliness. However, the adverse living environment did not have significant direct and mediated effects on the resident's self-assessed health. Besides, this study reveals that stressful status, including having a criminal record, being divorced, and the duration of unemployment, tended to be deleterious to the resident's psychosocial and physical well-being. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

  abstract = {Sixty-seven undergraduates completed the NEO-Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1985), the Rebelliousness Questionnaire (McDermott, 1987) and an author-devised creativity checklist. Reactive rebelliousness correlated positively with NEO-neurotic hostility (r = 0.52, p < .001) and negatively with NEO-openness to experience subscales ('actions', r=-0.21, p=0.46; 'ideas', r = -0.31, p = 0.005) but not with frequency of self-reported creative interests and activities. A disaggregated measure of creative activities however, demonstrated a positive association between number of creative literary acts and proactive rebelliousness scores (r = 0.25, p = 0.02). All six NEO-openness subscales correlated positively with self-reported creative activities; five did so with creative interests. Specifically, openness to fantasy and openness to aesthetic experience correlated notably with creative activities (r=0.45, p < 0.0005; r=0.41, p < 0.005) and interests (r=0.45, p < 0.0005; r=0.5, p < 0.0005). Thus, openness, as McCrae & Costa (1985) hypothesise, was highly predictive of self-reported creative acts and interests. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

  abstract = {The findings of three studies on money perceptions by Chinese subjects were reported. In Study 1, 378 kindergarten children (age five and six) were asked to give free associations to 86 Chinese words. The word money elicited a large number of associations (ranked ninth in five-year-olds and 21st in six year-olds), indicating that money was not an unfamiliar or uninteresting concept to children of very young age. Analysis also showed that the associations of money were primarily non-evaluative and functional in nature. In Study 2, 71 school teachers, 58 business people, and 338 high school students were asked to rate what money meant to them. Results showed that school teachers tended to perceive money as less good and honest than business people did. The student group was found to give lower goodness and power ratings than the two professional groups and lower honesty and interest ratings than the business group. The results thus showed that perceptions of money were very much related to one's social role. In Study 3, the relation of money attitudes and value orientation was examined in a sample of 1463 university students. Results showed that those who were high on preference for enjoyment, security, and achievement values, rated money more important than those low on these values. On the other hand, individuals who were high on the prosocial and maturity values rated money less important than those low on these values. The results thus indicated that the knowledge of people's value orientation would help to add to the understanding of their money perceptions. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Personal-emotional adjustment was included as the potential opposite of maladjustment. Factor analyses generally found two broad independent patterns constant across genders. Internalized Distress consisted of anxiety; depression; emotional stress; personal maladjustment; physical symptoms; eating problems; and eating traits. Alcohol Abuse consisted of amount and consequences of alcohol consumption.

According to Bandura (1965), observational learning is characterized by four stages: attention, retention, motor reproduction, and motivation. The first stage, attention, is a crucial subprocess that can be influenced by model characteristics. Characteristics such as attractiveness, trustworthiness, similarity, and perceived competence have been shown to enhance a model's effectiveness. This study extended this research to social power. It was hypothesized that observational learning effectiveness would be greater in groups taught by a model with a base of social power than in a control group. A research question examined which base of social power (legitimate, expert, or referent) yielded the greatest effectiveness. Subjects watched a tape of a model performing a puzzle task. The model was described as having one of the three bases of social power. A fourth group was taught by a model introduced without the mention of a base of social power. The results revealed that subjects in the power groups scored significantly higher on the variables of time elapsed to complete the puzzle, number of pieces correctly placed, and whether the subject finished or not. Implications for the findings of this study such as the use of social power(s) in a teaching and managerial setting are discussed. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

In addition, students in the 100%-50% and 67%-50% experimental conditions showed greater judgmental displacement from their anchoring judgments than participants in the 0%-50% and 33%-50% conditions. We attribute this finding to the psychological function for the judgment of contingency which indicates that a 50% contingency problem is typically judged to be less than it's objective contingency. In general, people show less judgmental sensitivity among contingencies below about .5 than among those above this value. This reduced sensitivity indicates that judgments among low levels of contingency are more difficult than judgments among high levels of contingency. Some self-efficacy research suggests that self-efficacy may be related to performance on difficult tasks but not easy tasks. In our experiment self-efficacy was related to judgmental displacement for students in the more difficult 0%-50% and 33%-50% conditions and was not related to judgmental displacement for students in the more easy 100%-50% and 67%-50% conditions. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

In this study, procedures used in previous studies were translated and administered to five- and eight-year-old children in Portugal. Both types of bias were found among the Portuguese children providing additional evidence that the pro-white and pro-light-skinned biases are pancultural tendencies. The biases were not different by gender, but they were higher among eight-year-old children than five-year-olds children and, hence, seemed more likely to be attributable to cultural learning. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The results indicate a link between economic situation, education and a narcissistic trait, and coherence. Moreover, the study found that among all the variables, from the narcissistic personality questionnaire, those main themes linked to feelings of entitlement and self-satisfaction made the most significant contribution to a sense of coherence.

The objective of the study is to contribute to the knowledge needed by counselors, school educators, and health professionals to develop and implement effective educational programs and counseling interventions that are race and gender specific. In particular, programs that promote the use of AIDS risk-reduction practices among African American male, college-age adolescents. We acknowledge that any potent effort to prevent the spread of the disease among men in the African American community must: a) evaluate existing prevention strategies used with a similar population, b) utilize activities that focus on collective cultural experience, c) utilize activities that enhance communication and accent collective participation, d) utilize strategies that focus on acceptance of sexuality, e) focus on re-occurring patterns of communication, f) base intervention on the current social and political climate, g) consider threats and belief of genocide as real, h) include messages which consistently emphasize the potential benefits and gains of community and i) consider racial/ethnic composition in the counselor-client relationship. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

These findings were replicated in the cross-validation sample. Results partially support self-presentation theories of shyness and suggest that while interpersonal competence and fear of rejection are central to shyness, the shy do not necessarily hold unrealistically high standards for themselves or view others as expecting perfection from them. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

As this study was conducted in Hawaii, it was hypothesized that the now dominant, competitive corporate societal model would give rise to societal pressures which would force those holding the traditional Aloha or love-oriented model of societal values into a conflicting role in this current society. This hypothesis was borne out in these transgenerational observations which showed that when using a Varimax orthogonal rotation on eighteen values, both the incarcerated men and women had factors which showed retention of the traditional family-oriented system of values. The non-incarcerated men had a very subordinate factor which included love-oriented values while the non-incarcerated women had no family-oriented value factor. This last group's absence of Aloha was interpreted as showing a non-conflicting integration into the now dominant, materialistic corporate value structure of Hawaiian society. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The televisions of the 10 videogame players were provided with Nintendo SuperNes systems. Participants played Super Tetris 5 hours a week for 5 weeks, and maintained a log of their play. Before and after this play period, measures of reaction time (Sternberg Test), cognitive/perceptual adaptability (Stroop Color Word Test), and emotional well-being (self-report questionnaire) were administered. Playing video games was related to a significant improvement in the Sternberg reaction time task, and to a relative increase in self-reported well-being. On the Stroop Color Word Test, both the experimental and control groups improved significantly, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant. The videogame-playing group had faster reaction times and felt a more positive sense of well-being compared to their nonplaying counterparts. Consistent with previous research on video games and the elderly, the present study finds the strongest effects on measures of reaction time, and the weakest effects on cognitive performance measures.

This experiment examines a basic interpretation proposed in the literature according to which, in a threatening situation, the choice of direction for a social comparison, upward or downward, depends on the self-improvement or self-enhancement goals pursued by the subjects. The results provide empirical support for this interpretation and show that diagnostic information about the target can change the direction of social comparison. Indeed, when the diagnostic information allows subjects to hold out some hope of improvement, they prefer an upward rather than a downward comparison. Conversely, when no improvement is possible, a downward comparison is preferred. This study suggests that the role of diagnostic information should be more closely examined when studying variations in the choices of direction of comparison as a function of the subjects' comparison goals. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Results indicated that the test-retest and split-half reliabilities of the MAS-R subscales were high. With regard to the validity of the scale, predicted levels of convergence were found between MAS-R subscales and the DIT stage scores but not between the MAS-R subscales and the VMS subscales. It was also found that the MAS-R discriminated between subjects' political and religious affiliations further strengthening its validity. Moreover, the item-total correlational analysis suggests that the MAS-R has strong structural validity. The present findings concerning the psychometric properties of the MAS-R not only replicate previous findings involving the MAS (White, 1996b) but provide stronger support amongst a broader sample.

Mental incongruity is what people experience when there is a discrepancy between how they think a situation should be (the standard) and how they experience the actual situation or their own behavior (the cognition). The mental incongruity theory is domain specific which connects well with Marcia's domain specific identity model. We studied the influence of adolescents' standards - how they would like their educational status to be or how they would like their social relations to be -and mental incongruity on the development of identity in the respective domains. By means of Lisrel, we tested hypotheses on a sample of 1230 Dutch adolescents, between the ages of 15 to 24. As expected, a higher standard led to more exploration and commitment and thus to a more developed identity, but also to more mental incongruity. More mental incongruity led in its turn to a less developed identity. Thus, a higher standard directly led to a more mature identity, but caused indirectly - via mental incongruity - a less mature identity. Furthermore, a low relational mental incongruity induced a low educational mental incongruity, and likewise a high relational identity somewhat increased the educational identity. Finally, the expected crisscross effects of the standard in one domain decreasing the mental incongruity in the other domain were found. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

The debate over gender differences in moral development has focused primarily on these two theories. Numerous studies and articles have been published deliberating both Kohlberg's and Gilligan's theories with most concluding there is no significant difference in the way the sexes make moral decisions.

These variables and the amount of television viewing on a weekday, exerted relatively strong cultivation effects on the adolescent viewer's mean world value, in terms of materialism and trivialization of moral value.

It has been suggested by Scott (1980) that general trust is not as useful in predicting behavior in organizational settings as is situational trust. However, if moderated by in-group - out-group status, general trust may be useful in predicting general response tendencies such as aggressive and prosocial behaviors. Building on the norm of reciprocity as described by Kaufmann (1970) and Rushton (1980), it was hypothesized that: a) subjects identified as high trusters would show low levels of aggression and high levels of prosocial behaviors towards both in- and out-group members; b) low trusters would show high levels of aggression and low levels of prosocial behavior towards both in- and out-groups members; and c) moderate trusters would show lower levels of aggression towards the in-group than towards the out-group and higher levels of prosocial behavior towards the in-group than towards the out-group. These hypotheses were not confirmed. Participants reported higher levels of prosocial behavior towards the in-group than towards the out-group, regardless of the level of trust. Group differences also emerged on the aggression measures regardless of trust level.

Two of these studies sampled children of alcoholics enrolled in an urban university and one sampled participants in a substance abuse treatment program. Factor analyses and correlational patterns across the three studies revealed that the private self-consciousness measure is composed of two orthogonal subscales, suggesting that the continued use of the entire 10-item private self-consciousness measure is inappropriate. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

As predicted, Innovators obtained significantly higher scores on uniqueness motivation than did Adaptors (p<.001), and Need for Uniqueness correlated substantially with Innovation (r=0.55). These findings provide support for the hypothesis that uniqueness-seeking may simply be a manifestion of extreme innovativeness rather than an independent dimension of personality. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

Girls were more external than boys only during late adolescence. However, blacks scored higher in externality than whites at both time periods and effect sizes were greater during late adolescence.

This theoretical intersection yields a conceptual other whose reflected image of us is both affect and cognition: the valenced other. This theoretical analysis produces a curvilinear relationship which is hypothesized to exist between image accuracy and the penetration level of the reference person. The most accurate images are, in descending order casual acquaintance, friend, intimate and stranger. The distortion in the intimate's image is due to their emotional involvement rendering them blind to otherwise obvious information. This paper argues that neither the looking-glass-self nor social penetration is complete alone. This resultant unified system gives rise to the valenced other concept. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

To test the Model, data were analyzed from a sample of undergraduate students at a large land-grant university. Results indicate that students with high levels of self-esteem, as well as high levels of knowledge of HIV/AIDS, report engaging in safer behavioral practices, for the non conventional sexual behaviors, more so than those with low and moderate levels of self-esteem. With respect to those more conventional sexual behavioral practices, such as unprotected vaginal/penile intercourse and unprotected sex with multiple sex partners, those with high self-esteem surprisingly reported more risky sexual behaviors than those with low and moderate self-esteem. These results indicate that both self-esteem and knowledge operate differently depending on the type of sexual behavior involved - conventional or non conventional. Such differences need to be taken into account when using the Health Belief Model in evaluating HIV/AIDS protective behavior among US college students. © Society for Personality Research (Inc.).},

It is hypothesized that subjects would be more likely to opt for abortion of a female fetus, and that this choice would be made more often when the impairment was physical as opposed to cognitive. The students were divided randomly into three groups and completed a questionnaire pertaining to a male, female, or gender-unspecified fetus. Gates syndrome was used as an example of a birth defect involving mild physical disfigurement, while Langs syndrome was cited to illustrate mild mental retardation. Subjects were asked to rate, on a scale from 1 (willing) to 7 (unwilling), their willingness to abort. Overall, female students were significantly (p 0.05) more unwilling to abort than their male counterparts. When scores for all six treatment conditions were combined, the mean scale rating in terms of willingness to abort was 4.97 for female students and 4.27 for male students. Unexpectedly, no evidence was found for sex bias in terms of the gender of the fetus or its interaction with the nature of the birth defect. The only mean score to fall below the neutral point of 4 was that for male students considering a gender-unspecified fetus with a physical defect (3.97).},
